			"title": "Clarification on &quot;Conversation with a Disciple&quot;",
			"date": "Wed, Dec 06, 2017",
			"author": "Niranjana Swami",
			"body": "<p>\r\n\tI've been informed that there is some misunderstanding about something which was transcribed from my \"Conversation with a disciple.\" I did not take any time to check and edit that transcription as I sometimes do with transcriptions. Hence, I decided to take the responsibility myself to clarify a point which may not be clear.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen I said, \"The sin can apply to many people. It's not just those sins which are inflicted upon us.\", I was responding particularly to the person sitting before me who was admitting that her perspective was jaded. She was suggesting that she was hating the sinner as much as the sin and she went on to explain how she was suffering from their sin.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI was therefore specifically addressing the tendency to hate the sinner when the sin causes our own suffering. In other words, when it causes pain to ourselves (unless, of course, it's the pain which comes from genuine Vaisnava compassion for other's sufferings…. which was not the case in this case) we tend to lose our objectivity and hate the sinner and not just the sin.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf our anger towards the sinner is based on pure Vaisnava compassion, then according to our Vaisnava siddhanta, it's justifiable to become angry with the sinner when the sinner willfully causes pain to other Vaisnavas. But that was not the case in this case either.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut even the Vaisnava anger mentioned above has to be closely looked at within one's own heart, much in the same way Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur has described in \"Amrita Vani\" in a quote I oftentimes speak from (cited at the end of this explanation):\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore, I said, \"the sin can apply to many people\" simply to emphasize this point, that it's better to not hate the sinner based solely on sins committed only to ourselves, much in the same way as Dharma the bull did not hate the personality of Kali for breaking his legs.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this regard, Srila Prabhupada explained the following point in his purport to SB 1.17.18:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Although the bull, or the personality of religion, and the cow, the personality of the earth, knew perfectly well that the personality of Kali was the direct cause of their sufferings, still, as devotees of the Lord, they knew well also that without the sanction of the Lord no one could inflict trouble upon them. According to the Padma Purana, our present trouble is due to the fructifying of seedling sins, but even those seedling sins also gradually fade away by execution of pure devotional service. Thus even if the devotees see the mischief-mongers, they do not accuse them for the sufferings inflicted. They take it for granted that the mischief-monger is made to act by some indirect cause, and therefore they tolerate the sufferings, thinking them to be God-given in small doses, for otherwise the sufferings should have been greater.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt was on this basis that I said, \"The sin can apply to many people.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI realize that this may not fully address whatever questions arose on this topic, but at this point in time, it's the most I can offer given all of the other matters I'm currently dealing with.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI sincerely hope, however, that at least some of the confusion has been cleared by this explanation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI will not be able to go any further than this, neither now nor in the immediate future.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur's quote:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIs anger toward those envious of devotees a limb of devotional service?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe should display anger toward those who are envious of devotees. This is a particular limb of devotional service. A lack of anger against blasphemers is unjustified. But we need to understand who is actually envious of devotees. Those who do not serve the Supreme Lord, the Supersoul and most blissful friend of all living entities, do not benefit themselves but instead invite trouble by their envy of Kṛṣṇa and the Vaiṣṇavas. Such people are branded as envious, and we should not show them mercy. These people become intoxicated by worshiping materialists. We should both ignore them and display our anger toward them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut before that, we have to see whether we ourselves are envious of devotees, whether we ourselves are actually serving Kṛṣṇa. Or are we serving something else on the pretext of serving Kṛṣṇa? How much are we attached to Kṛṣṇa? Are we trying to enjoy the objects meant for Kṛṣṇa’s enjoyment?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI think my enjoyment-prone material body is fiercely envious of Kṛṣṇa and His devotees, because instead of thinking constantly of Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet and happiness, I am busy worrying about my own happiness, blaspheming others, and looking for faults. I do not look at myself at all. I am such an offender at the feet of devotees that I should first learn to display anger toward myself. I am so envious of devotees that I should beat myself with shoes simply to purify myself. Then I can set an example for others and sincerely engage in the service of Hari, guru, and the Vaiṣṇavas. I must remember that everyone is worshiping Hari but me. I am unable to do so. I should also remember that I may die at any moment.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo first we should show anger toward our own sinful propensities, such as our desire for profit, adoration, and distinction and our propensity to cheat others. We must correct ourselves first. Otherwise, we cannot correct others. Then we have to correct those who are related to us, who are envious of the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa and who are pulling us toward material enjoyment by tempting us. This is the secret of success.\r\n</p>\r\n"

			"title": "Bada Haridas Prabhu&#039;s Bhajans",
			"date": "Sun, Dec 03, 2017",
			"author": "Niranjana Swami",
			"body": "<p>\r\n\tLast night I was chanting bhajans with the devotees assembled in the Towaco community both before and after Dhirasanta Maharaja's wonderful talk from Bhagavad-gita about the importance of controlling the mind.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen devotees were asking me to chant certain bhajans, most of which I had learned from Bada Haridas Prabhu, I felt I should give credit where credit is due.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBefore chanting the next bhajan, I decided to ask permission to tell a short story about how I came to learn bhajans from Bada Haridas Prabhu.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfter telling my story, which I won't repeat here due to time limits, I told everyone that I was holding on to many recordings of my first visit with Bada Haridas Prabhu in the late 1990's when I spent several evenings together with him and Panca Tattva dasa (also from Alachua) just chanting different bhajans with him and recording them for the purpose of learning them from him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt was during those recordings, that I realized that the Alachua community was in possession of a very valuable jewel which needed to be shared with the rest of the world. So I invited Bada Haridas Prabhu to come to Ukraine.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe rest is history… again, another story too long to repeat here.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI promised the devotees attending the Towaco program that I would make the bhajans Panca Tattva dasa recorded for me during those evenings in Alachua available for everyone if they wished to download them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI told everyone that I had approximately sixty recordings, which is true, but after looking at the files I realized that a good part of those recordings were done at a time other than when I was personally with Bada Haridas Prabhu. Before making all those additional recordings available, therefore, I should first check with Bada Haridas Prabhu and ask him if it's OK to release them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMeanwhile, I will post 16 of those recordings. These are the only ones I can find right now from the ones we chanted together in Alachua in the late 90's. Bada Haridas Prabhu was leading, I was drinking the nectar of his association and was also playing the mrdanga because there were only three of us present. Panca Tattva dasa was playing kartals.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou can download the files by clicking <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/a/niranjanaswami.org/file/d/1QHG51keDv3Hu9d2VgcZB6hjA1fsNAnMw/view?usp=sharing\">HERE</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krishna\r\n</p>\r\n"

			"title": "Conversation with a disciple",
			"date": "Sun, Nov 26, 2017",
			"author": "Niranjana Swami",
			"body": "<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI would like to discuss the same topic we discussed in our last conversation… about the devotees who are disturbing me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI don't remember all of the details of our conversation but I thought I said that if you accept them as they are, that the problem would go away. What I meant, I'm almost sure, is that if you just accept them as they are, it meant that you were accepting that however they dealt with you was for your own purification. If you see things in that way then you see Krishna's hand, that Krishna has arranged for you to be in this situation and this situation is meant for your own purification, and if you accept it in that way then you will no longer see them as problems anymore. I might have also given my own experience, that I oftentimes talk about, the time when my temple president was insulting me. Did I?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNot completely. But I remember.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou remember the story? Because I was speaking to you based upon my own experience, that it was very difficult for me to tolerate the way I was being dealt with by this particular temple president. And you know the story how I was asked to give SB class, and I was speaking, with references of the Bhagavatam about Maharaja Rahugana. And then I was getting such wonderful realizations that I realized that I could have never possibly gotten these realizations if my president hadn't treated me that way. And I became grateful. And then when I thanked him, in my heart, for the way he treated me. I really changed. The problems went away. And he stopped treating me that way. So it was based on my own realization.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDid you have any bad feelings toward him?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNo.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOK. Our situation in asrama. Ekadasi Night. Kirtan on the roof. I cannot sleep. I cannot go on harinama. And I'm tired and I want to sleep but the kirtan is very loud… mrdanga kartals etc. I cannot rest. The next day I feel completely broken. I do not have any desire to do anything. And I feel that they must not do that. It's not correct. I know. Kirtan is OK but&nbsp; there is time and circumstances. I mean when devotional service of someone disturbs my own devotional service, what should I do?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat else can you do but tolerate?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf course I had to tolerate.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYes. Because you tried to get them to change and they don't. I remember you telling me that also. You appealed to them. You appealed to others, and nothing changed. What else can you do?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI'm ready to tolerate, but I'm not ready to forgive them and to feel some good feelings towards them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, but then that means that your mind is disturbed by their presence. So keep you distance from them. Otherwise you're going to have to be disturbed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt's one building. No way to keep a distance. In our society we practically never speak about good manners, at least to be sensitive to other people.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe speak about this all of the time, but maybe they don't hear about it in your asrama, that's all. But I wouldn't say \"in our society\". That's a pretty broad generalization… in our society. Maybe in _________&nbsp; they don't speak about it in the women's asrama. But it is definitely talked about in many places. I certainly speak about it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou do. You always say that all of your good qualities are not your credit. But I can see that from the very beginning in your Krishna consciousness, you had many good qualities. And those qualities which you have now, you just developed your qualities which you had from the very beginning. Or you developed different qualities?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo tell you the truth, I don't remember a time when I deliberately decided to develop good qualities.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt seems that you have good qualities.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut the point is that I don't remember a time when I deliberately decided, \"I'm going to develop this quality.\" It's just something that evolved through my own experiences of interacting with other people. And chanting Hare Krishna and praying to my spiritual master. But I can't remember a time when I was thinking, \"Well I have to think about developing.\"...I can remember thinking, \"I have to be tolerant.\" That I can remember. I had to learn tolerance a lot in the beginning. But it's something that I've had to learn for forty-five years. Tolerance.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut when I see your example. For me it's a perfect example because you love people, and you do not discriminate against them and you do not see their faults. And you do not criticize them. I am an example of the opposite. And how can I learn this?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWell I always answer that question, when it's asked, not directly about me, but just in general, that if you want to develop the qualities that you see in others, the best way to develop their good qualities is by serving them. Consciously serving them, in the way I spoke about the other evening. I don't know if you were there? That's why I attribute that whatever good qualities others may see in me is only because I tried to consciously serve the person who was the embodient of all good qualities.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat can I do for you? Because my service during my service during your visit is so insignificant.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWell there are many other ways to serve me in the same way I have found in service to Srila Prabhupada. Telling others about Krishna is the way to serve me. Telling others about your own realizations in Krishna concsiousness is a way to serve me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBeing a good example. I oftentimes emphasize that the wrong act committed by the servant leads people in general to blame the master, and the opposite of that is that whatever good behavior there is in a disciple, always brings credit to the spiritual master. That's a way to serve me. And these are ways that disciples can serve in separation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen I am not present there are ways that you can serve me. I mean that there are also ways my disciples serve me who don't see me. For instance, transcribing my lectures. Or helping with printing of my books, or distributing the books, and these are also different ways disciples serve me when they are not physically with me. But these opportunities are available to anyone who wants to do it. But as far as direct personal service? You can't get much more personal than those services which I just described.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese are the services that mean the most to me. [Not serving my body.] These are the things that I speak about all of the time. These are the things that I try to invest so much of my energy and time in trying to teach others that when I see somebody reciprocating with my efforts to help them in that way, it gives me life. It gives me a purpose for being here. I feel reciprocation that I'm actually doing something to share what Prabhupada gave me with others. It just gives me life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe all have to feel a sense of purpose. That gives us life. We then feel like, \"I have some purpose for being here. Some purpose for being on this planet. I have some purpose to be recognized by others. That's the best way to be recognized, by service. Serving in the ways I just described is a powerful way to be recognized. Because it's not only simply by the recognition, as I told in my story. Prabhupada never recognized [externally] the rooms that I prepared for him. But he did recognize. Nobody will tell me that he didn't. He did.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOf course he did because you had a big desire to satisfy him. And in this age of Kali very often Krishna punishes us because sometimes it's the only way to strengthen our intelligence. How can we strengthen our intelligence in another way without punishment?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWithout being punished?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou don't like being punished..? Prabhupada, I think you must have heard me say this many times, because I quote Prabhupada on this. Prabhupada said that to strengthen our intelligence means that before we do anything, we compare it to the instructions we received from guru and Krishna. And by building everything that we do on those higher instructions, our intelligence becomes stronger. Prabhupada even said that for the disciple, intelligence means… the instructions of the spiritual master. Therefore before we do anything we should be thinking, \"Is this what I should be doing?\" And compare it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn the very beginning I had this feeling. I always before I do something, I always thought, what would you think about it. But then I lost this feeling. And I would like to restore it. And one time you spoke about sin and sinner, how to separate them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHate the sin and not the sinner, you mean?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYes. And I don't understand, because sin does not exist without sinner. How to separate that.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe sin can apply to many people. It's not just those sins which are inflicted upon us. But it can be those sins which have been inflicted upon anybody. So you hate the sin. Even when it happens to others, and you see others who are suffering as a result of that sin, including the sinner. So that's how you distinguish. Usually we put them together seeing the sin is that which has caused \"me\" suffering. But no. We have to learn how to distinguish between the sin and the sinner. The sin, in of itself, is universal. We can see another person committing a sinful act and the object of their sinful act suffers. The person who commits the sin, we think, \"That person is going to suffer.\" So we can hate the sin. But the sinner we feel compassion for. Why should they suffer. And why should the person who will be the object of their sin suffer also? So let me help this person so that they don't have to suffer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI meant devotees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou meant devotees? Well. What's the sin? Devotees are supposed to be sinless.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen they behave unfair and disrespectfully. But they are quite satisfied and pleased with themselves. So I cannot think about how they will suffer, because it doesn't look like they will suffer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut it seems like you're the one who suffers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUh-huh. Yes. I do.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBecause my parents, I was raised with the thought that we should take into consideration other people and we should not disturb them. And I don't do all of these things which they do. But they still do not like me. And they don't like that. And you may remember, that you said many years ago that if I do not learn how to associate with devotees I will never reach the spiritual world because Krishna is always surrounded by His devotees. So there is no hope.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy why does it have to be only those devotees. The ones who disturb you so much. Aren't there any other devotees who don't disturb you?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYes. There are.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo why don't you increase your association with them?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI do. But still I have to go to my place and I have to suffer. Because mostly I spend my time in my room. But I try to work on it, although not very successfully.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI can understand the difficulty. Familiarity breeds contempt. You have to live with that constantly. The same manner of dealings with you. They don't change. Your same attitude towards them. It doesn't change. And nothing changes. So usually under those circumstances when you are forced into a situation that can't be changed but you have no other choice but to accept it, it becomes more difficult to tolerate and that's the kind of living situation that you're in.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI can't sit down and talk to these people. Obviously you're not asking me to sit down and talk to these people, whoever they may be. And I'm grateful that you don't ask me to speak with them. I'm sure that you wouldn't even think of it. But what can I do? I don't even know who they are. And I don't even know if they have a potential to change. I don't even know if it's them. Or if it's something that you're doing that's provoking them to behave in that way. It doesn't sound to me like you are. From what you tell me, there's nothing you are doing to provoke them to deal with you in that way. It sounds to me that it's just a situation, or circumstance that you're all familiar with each others shortcomings and nobody is willing to make the changes required to make the relationships more harmonious. Everybody has reached their limit... including yourself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSometimes I'm in despair.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI can see that. I have no other way to try to help you except to help you internalize because I can't help you on the external platform.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYes. That's what I need from you. An internal change.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tInternal changes can only come by learning how to accept the situation that Krishna has put you in and to see that it's Krishna's will. \"There is no other reason to explain why I'm here? Why I'm doing this?&nbsp; It's been sanctioned by Krishna and if it's been sanctioned by Krishna, and if it's His will, I have to learn to accept it. And if He wants a different situation for me, then He'll arrange it.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe more you keep on hearing about Krishna and learning how Krishna is such a loving friend…. Krishna knows what's going on in our hearts. And Krishna will never do anything that's bad for us. And when we increase our hearing about Krishna, the more we see His presence in our life, and the more we become grateful. And then the more we become grateful, the more Krishna massages our hearts and we actually feel his presence more and more in our life, and we become peaceful. But it takes time for the whole process to take place. Somehow this place, this place, this ashram, these women, these circumstances, it's what you are being given right now as your test. And when you can actually accept it, it will become an opportunity for you to move on and then there will be more tests. But it's all because Krishna wants you, more than anything else, to come back to Him. He wants to make this your last visit to the material world. And he's going to make sure that every test that you get, He'll do His best to help you and give you the strength to overcome it so that you can remove all of these obstacles on your path, and go back to Godhead. You're so fortunate.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt's not so quick.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt may not be so quick. It may even not happen in this life. But you have a very auspicious opportunity to make it in this life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf I do some devotional service in my room, for example, listen to a lecture, and another mataji does the same thing very loudly and I cannot hear the lecture which I'm listening to, but instead of this, I'm listening to the cacophony from the corridor, what should I do in this case. I don't know. I become very angry in this case. Because they don't understand. I want to do something.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere is nobody who is responsible for this place where you stay. Is that what you're telling me?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTwo matajis… ________ and ___________.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut they don't listen to you?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThey don't listen to me. So for them it's not a problem at all. If I complain to someone who is in charge, I mean above them is it correct or not?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo complain is not the best approach. The best approach is to not come forward with a complaint demanding that someone should do something about it. The best approach is to very humbly come forward and ask the person, \"Is this the right situation. I'll describe it. Do you have time for me to describe it? If you don't have time for me to describe it, can I write it down, and will you read it? And then just give me an answer? Is this the right situation that I should tolerate? Or maybe do you see that there's something that could be done to improve the situation because I've been living like this for so long and I've been trying to tolerate but it's been very difficult for me.\" That's the best way, rather than to complain. Because people don't like it when somebody comes just to complain.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMaybe it's not the right word?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI'd say, \"making them aware.\" There's a difference between making somebody aware and complaining. A person who complains is usually somebody who wants somebody to do something about it. That's a complaint. \" I have a complaint. You do something about it. It's your resopnsibility.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI tried to do it one or two years ago.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo make somebody aware.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYes. Because they wanted to throw me out of the ashram. And there was some conversation between ______, ________, and _______&nbsp; who is above them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOh _________? He's the person who is above them?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe was at least one year ago.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t_________ is a very reasonable person.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYes. He is. When we talk with each other. Yes he is very reasonable. But when we talk together, he was on their side. Unfortunately very often I can see in our society that if you are an ordinary devotee and do not have any position, any title, then they will not listen to you. I don't want to think in such a way. But that's what I see.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI don't know what \"ordinary devotee\" means.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOrdinary devotee means not a Prabhupada disciple, not a scholarly brahmana, I don't know what. Sorry for this but that's what I think. One more question? How to realize that Krishna's name is not different from Krishna so that we would not ignore Him when we chant Hare Krishna?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo realize Krishna's name is nondifferent from Him, is not a mechanical process. It's not something that you can do and immediately see Krishna in His name. Like anything in spiritual life, Krishna always has the choice and final decision in how He will reveal Himself to every individual. He has the final decision. What works for one to achieve that decision may not be the exact same situation that works for another. But what works for everyone is love. And love is something very difficult. It's not so easy, it's not so cheap to have. To take lust which is \"for me\" and to completely turn it to love \"for Krishna\" requires a cleaning of the heart.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWithout ceto darpana marjanam, without a cleaning of the heart, you will not be able to see Krishna in His name. So it begins with cleaning the heart, which you are doing. But you have to continue the cleaning process. And to continue the cleaning process means that whatever obstacle you are facing right now in your spiritual life, you need to be able to overcome it. And if you don't overcome it, it will hinder your progress in being able to experience Krishna in His name. He won't reveal. He only reveals Himself to those whose hearts are clean.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo what do we do? How to get a clean heart? We get clean hearts by approaching Krishna in His name, approaching Him through prayer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI was speaking to somebody the other day and I was saying how powerful prayer is. That prayer is something that we have a tendency to minimize because it takes a lot of hard work to pray. Usually it's more comfortable for the mind to just kind of gravitate to the easier things to think about than to really go deep within our own hearts and to actually reveal something that Krishna already knows. But to reveal and speak to Him personally and saying, \"Krishna this is who I am, but I want to be \"this\" person, who is higher than I am. But I know that I can't be this person who's higher than I am without Your help.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo let me tell You all these things about who I am now, that's preventing me from becoming the higher person who I want to be. This is the type of person I want to be, but I'm telling all of these things because I can't come to that level of a \"higher person\" without Your help. And I'm suffering. Because I always see the person that I don't want to be, but I'm living with that person every day. And every day I'm living with the person I don't want to be, it causes me pain because I would really like to be the person who's higher.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut how do I get to that higher point unless You, Krishna, help me? Because I have no other way.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat's prayer. It takes work. It actually takes work. But that's what is required to become purified. It's work. And you're capable of doing it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tActually I never pray.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut you're capable of doing it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI hope so.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou have my blessings.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor praying? I repeat only one prayer from Ayurveda. It's not for the health. It's just very nice prayer. But I'm not sure that I can translate it into English. Maybe Prabhu can help?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe's putting together my Ayurvedic medicine for me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYes. I know. It sounds so nicely in Russian. I don't know how to translate it properly into English.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t“Dear Krishna, you are inside of me, within my very breath, within each bird, each mighty mountain. Your sweet touch reaches everything and I am well protected.<br />\r\n\tThank you Krishna for this beautiful day before me. May joy, love, peace and compassion be part of my life and all those around me on this day. I am healing and I am healed.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNiranjana Swami:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThat's your prayer?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDisciple:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMy only prayer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEnd of recording.\r\n</p>\r\n"

The recorder on my phone was somehow left on from a recording I had made shortly before the scheduled meeting with this disciple. I discovered the recording on my phone some time later.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen I listened to the recording, I thought that this is something others may benefit from hearing as well. So it was transcribed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThen, through another disciple, I asked this senior disciple if she would mind if the transcription was posted. I was told that she was fine with it being posted, \"as is\". But I chose to remove a few details which I felt did not have to be included.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI generally do not record my meetings with disciples. I do not want them to be intimidated by the presence of a recorder. But, after some thought, I realized that there are many disciples who ask if they may record their conversations with me. Rarely, at least that I can remember, have I ever denied somebody's request to record their private conversation with me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe thought then occurred to me, \"Maybe there are more private recordings in the possession of disciples and/or aspiring disciples, which may be of similar value?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHence, I am now thinking about beginning a \"Conversations with a disciple\" series for my blogs. They wouldn't be frequent. It would take time to transcribe them, edit them, and post them. But it could begin by asking my readers if they have such a recording in their possession which they feel could be of benefit for others to hear?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf there are personal parts which the possessor of the recording prefer not be transcribed and posted, they could be edited out. In fact, I would personally edit them out. Anonymity could also be kept, much in the same way that my books of letters have been presented.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAdditionally, confidentiality would be maintained, much in the same way that complete confidentiality is kept by those who translate letters both to me and from me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you, or anyone you know, have a recorded conversation which you (or they) would like to share, these recordings can be uploaded, along with editing requests , here on the Fileshare page of this site:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\thttps://www.niranjanaswami.net/en/fileshare\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krishna\r\n</p>\r\n"

Among the angas of bhakti, which is defined as the chief one, standing out like an emperor exerting power everywhere? This verse answers that question. Among the angas of bhakti, hearing, chanting, and remembering are the three chiefs. . . . Among these three, chanting is the chief. In chanting, however, there is chanting of the Lord’s name, chanting of His qualities, and chanting of His pastimes. Among these anukirtana (chanting of His name according to one’s own bhakti) is best. Anukirtana also means continuous chanting. This is not only my conclusion; this has been concluded (nirnitam) by the previous acaryas. Therefore there is no need for further inquiry or proofs.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n"

Of course Srila Prabhupada had a vision that temples would be established all over the world in every town and village. But with the TOVP, Srila Prabhupada gave so many details, from the significance of the temple down to the details directly related to its design.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI left my tour with renewed conviction that devotees throughout the world should continue to give their support to the TOVP so that we may realize Srila Prabhupada's complete dream for the TOVP within our lifetime. So much work is yet to be done, and so many funds are still required for the work to continue.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI laud the efforts of the TOVP team, headed by my godbrother, Ambarish Prabhu, the Chairman of the project and I pray that more and more devotees will become inspired to help realize the temple opening in the year 2022.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDevamrita Maharaja came along with me for the tour.

			"author": "Niranjana Swami",
			"body": "<p>\r\n\tWhenever the GBC Body meets with members of the Strategic Planning Team (SPT), my godsister, Laxmimoni dasi, usually reads something from Srila Prabhupada for the benefit of all those who are present before anything else is discussed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne of Laxmimoni's services is to go through the Vedabase and to pull out inspirational quotes in order to put all of us into the right mindset for discussing the topics on the agenda for each day.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, Laxmimoni doesn't just extract quotes. She stitches them together in a way to keep the topic and mood nicely flowing and so that she can stay within the time allotted to her before the start of the meetings. Then she reads it with such relish that any sincere follower of Srila Prabhupada cannot help but be moved with inspiration. I've also found myself moved to tears quite often.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tUnfortunately, I cannot replicate the exact experience for my readers here in this blog. In order to fully understand what I'm saying, one has to be present, listening to Laxmimoni dasi read.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut before I left Ujjain, I asked Laksmimoni if she would share her readings with me so that I could share it with others.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe following is one of the many references she sent to me. It is from a room conversation in Tokyo, in 1974. I will gradually share more of these in the future.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThese symptoms of love mean one must give and take. One must disclose his mind and take instruction. One must give him to eat, and one must take something from him to eat. These are the six symptoms of love. Give and take. Just like you have given me this flower, so you have given. So if I instructed, “You take it,” that is give and take. If I offer you prasadam, you should bring some foodstuff. You should disclose your mind, and you should say that “This is my problem; you should hear me.” This is a symptom of love. Everything is there.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tdadati pratigrhnati&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; guhyam akhyati prcchati<br />\r\n\tbhunkte bhojayate caiva&nbsp;&nbsp; sad-vidham priti-laksanam<br />\r\n\t[Upadesamrta 4]\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo our only request is that our business is we are in this old age traveling four times in a year. What is material benefit out of it? I am old man. I cannot move. I am eighty years, and two years less. Naturally this is not the age for traveling, retirement. But why I am traveling? Because I wanted to satisfy my Guru Maharaja. That is the only reason. I wanted to satisfy the desire of my Guru Maharaja, the desire of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. And therefore at night I don’t sleep; I dictate. I publish this book. I go from country to country, village to village, town to town. And they also reciprocate, these boys. They’re helping me, how to publish these book, these boys. That boy is editing twenty-four hours; he is typing. Do I pay them anything?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t… This is love. “I go away from Guru Maharaja and live four hundred miles away, and I love Guru Maharaja.” … Nonsense. You show some symptoms of love, that “My Guru Maharaja wants to do this. Oh, I must help him.” Just like Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted, prithivite achhe yata nagaradi gram: “As many towns and villages are there, everywhere must there be…broadcasting My missionary activities.” ... … Just like a Christian, if he is real Christian, if he is actually following Lord Jesus Christ, Christ says, “Thou shalt not kill.” He must propagate, “You shall not kill.” But where is that Christian who is propagating? They are killing…\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t… It is clearly said in the first commandment, “Thou shalt not kill.” So every Christian, they must preach this cult. That is Christian. And he’s helping killing, and he’s a Christian? Similarly, Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s mission is prithivite achhe yata nagaradi gram: “As many towns and villages are there, you must preach this cult.” That is really devotee, one who is doing this. He may not be very successful preacher; that doesn’t matter. Because he is doing that, he is first-class devotee.…that is real love. That is real follower. What his predecessor has ordered, that must be done. At any risk. It doesn’t matter whether it is being nicely done or not nicely done—because he is attempting to do that, that is sufficient. That very attempt will make him successful. This is the principle. You see?... Vyavasayatmika buddhih. Unfortunately, you do not read. What for we are publishing so many books, for the enlightenment of the people?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tvyavasayatmika buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana<br />\r\n\tbahu-sakha hy anantas ca buddhayo 'vyavasayinam<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t“Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one. O beloved child of the Kurus, the intelligence of those who are irresolute is many-branched.”<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t… “Who are irresolute.” Now, our only resolution was that “Guru Maharaja wanted this. Let me try it.” And with resolute purpose, I tried it. And therefore, I do not know, but people say that I have done very wonderful. People say that. … But what is the secret of this success? That resolution, that “My Guru Maharaja wanted this. I shall try my best to do this,” that’s all. I have no other secrets. Rather, I was doubtful, that “What I have got position, how people will understand? Still, let me try my best,” that’s all.\r\n</p>\r\n"
