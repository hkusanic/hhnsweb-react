			"title": "Clarification on &quot;Conversation with a Disciple&quot;",
			"date": "Wed, Dec 06, 2017",
			"author": "Niranjana Swami",
			"body": "<p>\r\n\tI've been informed that there is some misunderstanding about something which was transcribed from my \"Conversation with a disciple.\" I did not take any time to check and edit that transcription as I sometimes do with transcriptions. Hence, I decided to take the responsibility myself to clarify a point which may not be clear.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen I said, \"The sin can apply to many people. It's not just those sins which are inflicted upon us.\", I was responding particularly to the person sitting before me who was admitting that her perspective was jaded. She was suggesting that she was hating the sinner as much as the sin and she went on to explain how she was suffering from their sin.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI was therefore specifically addressing the tendency to hate the sinner when the sin causes our own suffering. In other words, when it causes pain to ourselves (unless, of course, it's the pain which comes from genuine Vaisnava compassion for other's sufferings…. which was not the case in this case) we tend to lose our objectivity and hate the sinner and not just the sin.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf our anger towards the sinner is based on pure Vaisnava compassion, then according to our Vaisnava siddhanta, it's justifiable to become angry with the sinner when the sinner willfully causes pain to other Vaisnavas. But that was not the case in this case either.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut even the Vaisnava anger mentioned above has to be closely looked at within one's own heart, much in the same way Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur has described in \"Amrita Vani\" in a quote I oftentimes speak from (cited at the end of this explanation):\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTherefore, I said, \"the sin can apply to many people\" simply to emphasize this point, that it's better to not hate the sinner based solely on sins committed only to ourselves, much in the same way as Dharma the bull did not hate the personality of Kali for breaking his legs.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn this regard, Srila Prabhupada explained the following point in his purport to SB 1.17.18:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\"Although the bull, or the personality of religion, and the cow, the personality of the earth, knew perfectly well that the personality of Kali was the direct cause of their sufferings, still, as devotees of the Lord, they knew well also that without the sanction of the Lord no one could inflict trouble upon them. According to the Padma Purana, our present trouble is due to the fructifying of seedling sins, but even those seedling sins also gradually fade away by execution of pure devotional service. Thus even if the devotees see the mischief-mongers, they do not accuse them for the sufferings inflicted. They take it for granted that the mischief-monger is made to act by some indirect cause, and therefore they tolerate the sufferings, thinking them to be God-given in small doses, for otherwise the sufferings should have been greater.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt was on this basis that I said, \"The sin can apply to many people.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI realize that this may not fully address whatever questions arose on this topic, but at this point in time, it's the most I can offer given all of the other matters I'm currently dealing with.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI sincerely hope, however, that at least some of the confusion has been cleared by this explanation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI will not be able to go any further than this, neither now nor in the immediate future.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHare Krsna\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur's quote:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIs anger toward those envious of devotees a limb of devotional service?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe should display anger toward those who are envious of devotees. This is a particular limb of devotional service. A lack of anger against blasphemers is unjustified. But we need to understand who is actually envious of devotees. Those who do not serve the Supreme Lord, the Supersoul and most blissful friend of all living entities, do not benefit themselves but instead invite trouble by their envy of Kṛṣṇa and the Vaiṣṇavas. Such people are branded as envious, and we should not show them mercy. These people become intoxicated by worshiping materialists. We should both ignore them and display our anger toward them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut before that, we have to see whether we ourselves are envious of devotees, whether we ourselves are actually serving Kṛṣṇa. Or are we serving something else on the pretext of serving Kṛṣṇa? How much are we attached to Kṛṣṇa? Are we trying to enjoy the objects meant for Kṛṣṇa’s enjoyment?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI think my enjoyment-prone material body is fiercely envious of Kṛṣṇa and His devotees, because instead of thinking constantly of Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet and happiness, I am busy worrying about my own happiness, blaspheming others, and looking for faults. I do not look at myself at all. I am such an offender at the feet of devotees that I should first learn to display anger toward myself. I am so envious of devotees that I should beat myself with shoes simply to purify myself. Then I can set an example for others and sincerely engage in the service of Hari, guru, and the Vaiṣṇavas. I must remember that everyone is worshiping Hari but me. I am unable to do so. I should also remember that I may die at any moment.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo first we should show anger toward our own sinful propensities, such as our desire for profit, adoration, and distinction and our propensity to cheat others. We must correct ourselves first. Otherwise, we cannot correct others. Then we have to correct those who are related to us, who are envious of the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa and who are pulling us toward material enjoyment by tempting us. This is the secret of success.\r\n</p>\r\n"
