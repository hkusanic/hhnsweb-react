And anyone who has never tasted, he also laments, oh I have never tasted. So one who has tasted, and one who has not tasted, both are lamenting. Wife is like that. You have already tasted, now you are lamenting. But my advice to you is not to try to taste again, otherwise your lamentation will increase. You have got no children, so you are free, so take sannyasa. Sex life is nasty, but out of illusion we think it is nice. Now you are experienced, so don't take sex life again. You should not take sannyasa out of sentiment nor artificially, but it is better to accept it anyway.</p>\n<p>Letter to Jayananda das, 1 September, 1975</p>\n",

He says that a moment is appearing to me as 12 years, and my eyes are tearing torrents of rain, and I am feeling everything vacant in the absence of Govinda. The thing is that as we go on chanting Hare Krishna, in the pure status, we shall be on the loving platform and at that time, we shall feel the greatest separation from the Lord; but that feeling of separation from the Lord is more relishable than meeting the Lord. These are all transcendental existential understandings and as we grow in Krishna Consciousness, we understand everything, gradually, by the Grace of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, and He reveals Himself to the devotee with the progress of Krishna Consciousness. Thank you very much for your writing me.</p>\n<p>Letter to Makhanlal, 21 October, 1968</p>\n",

Srila Rupa Goswami has described that devotional service can be advanced by six processes. Perhaps you know them. They are as follows: enthusiasm, patience, conviction, following the regulative principles, being honest in one's profession, and in the association of devotees. So this Krishna consciousness society is especially meant for giving people the opportunity to associate with devotees. Devotees means who are following the regulative principles. One cannot be independent and at the same time become a devotee because all devotional activities are based on surrender. So in the association of devotees we learn this important item—how to surrender, but if we keep our independence and try to become devotees, that is not possible.</p>\n<p>Letter to Rayarama, 22 October, 1971</p>\n",

But yourselves being such qualified and experienced preachers, what is the benefit of engaging in the second-class activity when there is so much preaching work to be done? Practically speaking, our Krishna philosophy will save the whole world from the most dangerous condition, that is a fact. So now you just become convinced yourselves of this fact and help me spread this Movement for saving the world with all conviction and attention, and in this way you will be performing the highest type of activity and very soon you will go back to Home, back to Godhead, know it for certain.</p>\n<p>Letter to Vamanadeva and Indira dasi, 8 December, 1971</p>\n",

If anyone thinks like that, that a pure devotee should be obeyed and no one else, that means he is a nonsense. We advise everyone to address one another as Prabhu. Prabhu means master, so how the master should be disobeyed? Others, they are also pure devotees. All of my disciples are pure devotees. Anyone sincerely serving the spiritual master is a pure devotee, it may be Siddhasvarupa or others, a-Siddhasvarupa. This must be very clearly stated.

We should not give indulgence to our senses more than what is required just to keep body and soul together. We should not engage ourselves in very difficult tasks, and we should not talk anything more than what is necessary for spreading Krishna Consciousness. We should follow the regulative principles, regard being had to situation, circumstances and objectives. We should not be greedy and we should not mix with persons not interested in Krishna. In this way, we can make steady progress and maintain our membership in Krishna's family. Thus, at the end of this life we will enter actually into the spiritual world. So your main business should be to spread Sankirtana, becoming tolerant as the tree and becoming humbler than the grass. If you have anytime any difficulty, please try to settle up in the above way, but do not leave the company of devotees. That will not help you, even though there may seem to be some difficulties.</p>\n<p>Letter to Uttamasloka, 7 June, 1969</p>\n",

There is a verse in Srimad-Bhagavatam which was explained by Lord Caitanya in 64 different ways before Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya. In that verse it is stated that even the atmaramas or the persons who take transcendental pleasure in their own self - actually people should be trained up to be happy with one's own self. So the yogis and the philosophers, they are trying to be satisfied with their own self. But even such persons are attracted by the pastimes of Radha-Krishna, because the transcendental qualities of Radha-Krishna is attractive for persons who are already liberated from the 3 material qualities.</p>\n<p>Letter to Jadurani, 9 July, 1968</p>\n",

If some ordinary man gives sufficient remuneration to a worker, why Krishna will not give sufficient remuneration to His servants? But we should always remember that whatever Krishna gives us, that never becomes ours. It is Krishna's. The more we receive from Krishna, the more we engage the remunerations in the service of Krishna. That is the duty of a bona fide brahmana. A Vaisnava is automatically a bona fide brahmana. There is a proverb that a brahmana remains a beggar even if he receives $100,000. That means that a brahmana is supposed to spend all of his money for Krishna as he receives it from Krishna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLetter to Brahmananda, 24 July, 1969\n</p>\n",

Sound is for my pleasure.\" When we see something that definitely can offer some enjoyment for our senses, whether that be the tongue, the ears, the eyes, or the sense of touch - immediately we think, \"Yes, let me take it and enjoy it for myself.\" So, one who sees things this way, he doesn't see Krishna. It is very difficult for him to see Krishna.

But whenever Lord Caitanya met Sanatana Goswami, He used to embrace him in spite of Sanatana's request for Him not to touch him. Because of this, Sanatana Goswami later on decided to commit suicide so Lord Caitanya would not embrace him in his bloody condition. This plan was understood by Lord Caitanya, and He called Sanatana Goswami and said to him, \"you have decided to end this body, but don't you know that this body belongs to Krishna? You have already dedicated your body to Krishna so how can you decide to end it?'' So you must not neglect the upkeep of your body. This is the lesson we get from Lord Caitanya and Sanatana Goswami.

Without devotion to Krishna it is not possible to understand anything about Him.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMarch 8, 1991, Izori\n</p>\n",

However so called gentleman one may be or academically educated he may be he is hovering over the mental plane and therefore he must commit nuisance being influenced by the external energy. A person who has however unflinching faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead has all the good qualifications of the demigods.'' In other words you should not keep your trust on so called gentlemen of the world however nicely dressed he may be.

The actual fact is that attachment for sense gratification is not at all congenial for spiritual progress.

Therefore we have to take little precaution and the best precaution is to raise oneself in Krsna Consciousness. Lord Caitanya said that His mind becomes agitated even by seeing a wooden model. By seeing women, if one's mind is agitated, that is quite natural. If you take the words of Lord Caitanya that His mind is agitated by seeing a wooden model, then what to speak of us by seeing actual women.<br />\n\tThe real fact is therefore that we have to check ourself by advancement of Krishna Consciousness. But if it becomes too difficult for us, then one should get himself married and thus check his sex disturbance, and peacefully prosecute Krishna Consciousness. But if one can avoid sex life and the attachment is overturned for Krishna Consciousness, his position is very laudable.

Krishna will offer you all protection and make all suitable arrangements for His devotees to engage in His service. Thank you for your keen interest.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLetter to Mrs. Perera, 27 April, 1976\n</p>\n",

As for land ownership, in the Vedic civilization the land was given to the people for cultivation not for ownership, and a tax was collected which was 25% of the person's income. The land belonged to the state and the man would cultivate it and pay 25% to the state. If he has no income then he doesn't have to pay. If he doesn't pay tax he may be disowned of the land. One cannot get land from the government unless he agrees to produce something and if everyone produces food then there is no scarcity. At least he has his own food produced by himself. Now people are educated as sudras. They are going to work to produce what is not urgently needed by society.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLetter to Balavanta, 28 April, 1974\n</p>\n",

There is no difficulty, but now it becomes complicated. One must use electricity. Noise is there and when it breaks then you can not shave.

One thing is that I do not know how practical it is to carry deities in the truck, by the jarring of the vehicle there may be some damage and also I think that it is not possible to keep the top standard of worship, cleanliness, punctual offerings etc. We must be very careful about deity worship, if it is neglectful then it is very offensive and that will not help us, we should not do it simply for show. My suggestion is that all our buses should be outfitted with the picture of Guru Gauranga, that will be quite nice. Main business of traveling buses is to distribute books profusely, what do you think?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLetter to Sudama, 28 August, 1973\n</p>\n",

This stage means he should move amongst people to draw their attention to the New Vrindaban scheme and try to attract their attention for its development. So he should immediately begin this bahudaka program and collect money from outsiders, not from insiders.

The basic understanding is that Sada-Siva is an expansion of Maha-Visnu and that same Sada-Siva incarnates as Advaitacarya. Therefore, since Advaitacarya is an incarnation of Sada-Siva who is non-different from Maha-Visnu, we can say that Advaitacarya is an incarnation of Maha-Visnu. It can be said both ways, that He is an incarnation of Sada-Siva or Maha-Visnu.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLetter to Mr. Karl, 6 April, 1975\n</p>\n",

      "body": "<p>\n\tWe experience true love when Krishna is placed in the center of a relationship. If everyone keeps themselves as the center, they will feel an overwhelming degree of impersonalism. They will have their orbit and they will not want anyone to penetrate it. Then there is no love, only tension, as each of us thinks that we have what we need to maintain ourselves and our families, and if anything comes to disrupt that security, we will push it out of our way. How is that love? It’s impersonalism. Loving relationships develop when there is an effort to do something collectively to please Krishna. The catalyst for such unified action is hearing. The more we hear, the more we will understand the Lord’s messages and the more we will realize how important it is for us to make a personal sacrifice to achieve His goals. Therefore, love begins when the devotees hear and chant together. Love is not based on sentimentality. Loving relationships are formed when we place Krishna in the center—not sentimentally, but with intelligence.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t(Istaghosti Boston, April 1995)\n</p>\n",

Another principle is that those who are brahmacaris, they should sacrifice all of their income and collection for the Krishna Consciousness Movement, whereas those who are married should work, earning money as much as possible, and at least 50% should be spent for the Krishna Consciousness Movement. So we have no objection for allowing you to get married, but it is up to you to consider if you will work hard and earn money both for Krishna and for your family. You cannot get married, and at the same time do not earn money. Of course, by preaching Sankirtana Movement, if you are satisfied with a small income, that is also nice.

If they speak well but cannot control their senses, how can you trust them?

However, before we are able to perceive the Lord’s dictations, we must purify our existence. To purify our existence, we must accept some discipline by which our hearts can become cleansed. Lord Brahma is an example of this. He was the first created being within the universe, and he had no one he could accept as spiritual master except Krishna. Lord Brahma wanted to understand his origin. Therefore, he voluntarily accepted the discipline the Lord Himself prescribed. When Lord Brahma entered the Garbhodaka Ocean through the stem of the lotus, he heard the syllables “tapa”. Brahma accepted that these syllables were of divine origin, so he agreed to follow them and underwent great austerities for a thousand celestial years by sitting on his lotus seat in meditation. The result of Brahma’s obedient austerity was that the Lord personally revealed Himself to him and showed him the expanse of the Vaikuntha planets.<br />\n\t(Lecture SB 1.8.29 St.Peterburg)\n</p>\n",

Ultimately, we have to make ourselves susceptible or open to hearing from others if we wish to clear our hearts. We have probably also all had the experience of seeing our chief attachments—attachments to which we are usually blind—in others. The tendency to find fault in others is quite deep. It means we take our faults and blame them on others. Or, we are so busy looking for faults in others that we do not have time to look for them in ourselves.

Most of us find that practicing devotional service does not relieve our suffering, or it produces other kinds of suffering. Sometimes people are disappointed by this and even give up their devotional service in frustration. It is because they were attached to relief from pain even more than they were attached to being able to taste the nectar at Krishna’s feet. Such persons then go out to search elsewhere for pain relief. Of course, if even for a moment we receive the taste of Krishna’s lotus feet, we will feel fully satisfied and our sufferings will pale in comparison. We will not be able to forget the taste of devotional service ever again. The trick is, then, to get even a minute taste of real Krishna consciousness.

This is easily reconciled by the devotee’s unwillingness to claim the credit for his preaching, and for his overwhelming desire to share the glories of the Lord with others. A Vaishnava always offers his obeisances to his superiors in his mind before speaking to others, then offers obeisances to his audience. Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami does that often in the Caitanya-caritamrita. He offers his obeisances to the readers, because they are eager to drink the nectar emanating from the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya. He thinks as he writes, “By their blessing and by the blessings of my superiors I will be qualified to say something worth saying.” In this way he remains a servant, free from pride. He never thinks of himself as a great orator but only as a humble conduit for the Lord’s mercy.<br />\n\t(Sri Siksastaka- bhasya, Moscow 5.17.2001)\n</p>\n",

It is guaranteed.<br />\n\t(SB 4.23.12, Kishinyov, June 1996)\n</p>\n",

At that time the baby is allowed to be born but, unfortunately during the Kali yuga as soon as the child is come out of the womb he is in 90% of the cases he is not given any facility to further its KC. However in your case Krishna has shown this soul great mercy. The Bhagavat also says that no one should become the parent unless he can deliver the child from the clutches of death.

Usually when we speak about others, we do so only to point out their faults. Sometimes people who do not control their speaking urge regret what they have said. Not only have their words disturbed others, they have disturbed their own mind. The original speaker may question himself, “Why did I speak like that? Maybe I shouldn’t have said what I said.” Although this thought process may go on in the minds of many individuals, gossip continues. Why? Because we are pushed by the urge to speak unnecessarily. But Bhaktivinoda Thakura advises that if we do feel the urge to speak, but we have nothing of value to say, we should keep quiet. This is the standard of behavior devotees should maintain in one another’s association. When devotees gather, it is better (and a higher standard) to say nothing at all if all that can be said is gossip.<br />\n\t(Bhaktyaloka, Moscow)\n</p>\n",

They may be afraid that speaking about Krishna makes them look puffed-up. But the Krishna-katha has to start flowing somewhere. We should be aware that we are practitioners. We are not pure devotees gathering for sadhu-sanga. A practitioner is someone who is practicing, who has not yet reached the spontaneous platform. Therefore, he doesn’t feel the spontaneous realization that Krishna is present in his life at every moment. Because he doesn’t have that realization, he will not be able to share it with others. His Krishna-katha may not have the same impact that a pure devotee’s conversation would have. Nonetheless, he is a practitioner, so let him practice. This may take common agreement. Can everyone agree that we are practitioners in devotional service? Then we should agree to practice speaking about Krishna. By such practice, we will begin to realize the satisfaction that comes from Krishna-katha. <br />\n\t(Bhaktyaloka, Moscow)\n</p>\n",

In your country the dog is protected, and the cow is killed. The dog is passing stool and urine in the street, he is considered the best friend of man, and the cow is all pure, stool, urine, and milk, but they are taken to the slaughter house and killed for food.

That is true in one sense, that anyone who takes to Krishna Consciousness may elevate himself to the highest status of life. Krishna mentions many types of higher beings in Bhagavad-gita, such as demigods and those who dwell on higher planets. We have information that there are 8,400,000 species of life. Out of these, 400,000 species are considered human life. Of these 400,000, how many species do we find in our experience? Not many, probably less than 1,000, so we must conclude that there are hundreds of thousands of higher and lower types of human forms. But this does not mean that automatically one body evolves into a higher body.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLetter to Upendra, 8 December, 1971\n</p>\n",

But also we must remember that such failure will not discourage us from executing the most important mission of our life, to become fully in Krishna Consciousness. So whatever falldown has been, you should be regretful about it, but it is not so serious nor is it a permanent disqualification. But you must try to check yourself from such artificial things and take full shelter of the Lotus Feet of Krishna. I think that for such checking marriage is the only solution. It is understood that everyone has some nasty habits but by sticking to Krishna Consciousness, chanting our required rounds loudly, and tending the deities, these items will surely save you.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLetter to Upendra, 9 December, 1968\n</p>\n",

However, if we try to overcome the obstacles by our own endeavors alone, we will always fail. We cannot be successful in such endeavors. A devotee always has to be dependent upon the mercy of the Lord. That is one of the symptoms of surrender.<br />\n\t(Collected Letters to My Disciples, Vol 3, Pg 118 3rd Paragraph)\"\n</p>\n",

It gradually became more and more obvious to me that preaching was something that must be very pleasing to Srila Prabhupada. Otherwise, how could I feel so much spiritual satisfaction from it?

Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakur explains in Madhurya Kadambini that faith arises in two ways. One is spontaneously, or svabhaviki (as a result of some previous contact with devotional service), or if it is not spontaneously there, the second way it arises is called baladutpadita—by the forceful preaching of another. Forceful preaching doesn't mean that it could be compared to binding somebody's arm behind their back and forcing them to do something against their will. Srila Prabhupada would oftentimes say that \"purity is the force.\" This means that even though one may speak very simply, without pressuring another into doing anything against his own will, if his motive is pure, there is a particular \"force\" in his words, and that force has a way of compelling someone who has actually heard to act. In other words, by coming in contact with purity, one gets faith, and when one hears from someone with realization and taste, he develops a desire to obtain that which this person possesses.<br />\n\t(Collected Letters to My Disciples, Vol 3, Pg 119 2nd Paragraph)\n</p>\n",

Do not do these things because you have to do it. What comes in return cannot be compared to anything else within this entire cosmic manifestion. It is the experience of love that Krishna has for each and every one of His parts and parcels. If we want to experience this genuine love, we simply must offer something to Krishna with love.<br />\n\t(Collected Letters to My Disciples, Pg 198, last Paragraph)\n</p>\n",

Second, it means cultivation towards the object of our priti, or affection, through manasi-bhava, the sentiments of the heart and mind.

Chanting and dancing make one relieved of all material burdens.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLetter to Hamsaduta, 23 March, 1969\n</p>\n",

So that small particle is described in the Bhagavad-gita that na jayate na mriyate. That small particle has also no birth and death. Na hanyate hanyamane sarire [Bg. 2.20].

My answer to that would be \"no\". Let others make such judgements. That is their own problem. But if they are serious sadhakas and they are sincere -- the type of people that you should want to associate with -- the day will come when they will begin to appreciate your prior unwillingness to take part in their prajalpa. If they are not sadhakas and you need to associate with them for reasons other than the direct service of Krishna, then you should simply avoid opening your heart to them. Maintain some small talk with them, but don't forget that your association with them is not for spiritual purposes, but for some other business which needs to be done while you are still in a material body. Affection should be reserved for those who are devotees of Krishna. Affection towards non-devotees is shown by helping them to turn their attention toward Krishna.<br />\n\tCollected Letters to Friends and disciples Vol 5, Pg 119, last paragraph.\"\n</p>\n",

Expansion is something that is not always calculated by some external criteria. We have a tendency in the material world to see how things are expanding in terms of economic growth. But the previous acaryas, Vaishnavas and speakers of Srimad-Bhagavatam use a different barometer for real success. They measure it in terms of growth that takes place within the heart, and the growth that takes place in the relationships with Vaishnavas. When affection begins to grow within the heart through the association of Vaishnavas, then envy and the tendency to find faults in others begins to leave the heart.<br />\n\t(Lectures from a disciple, Vol 3, Expansion of Krishna Consciousness , Pg 388, 1st and 3rd Paragraph)\n</p>\n",

Similarly, for these different symptoms of material prosperity to come down, Krishna can take it all away, or we can use it in Krishna's service—yukta-vairagya.   By using things for the service of the Lord, the fever will come down. In this way, we can try to become spiritually healthy, and that will be our process of expansion. We need more and more spiritually healthy devotees who can go out and preach and show by their example what it means to be Krishna conscious. Krishna consciousness will then expand unlimitedly. I ask you all to please help spread the mission of Krishna consciousness. Become fixed up devotees in Krishna consciousness and go out and make others Krishna conscious.

We should be very careful not to follow rules and regulations simply for their own sake, forgetting the purpose behind them.

Married life in Krishna Consciousness is the perfection of married life because the basic principle is that the wife will help the husband so that he may pursue Krishna Consciousness, and similarly the husband will help the wife to advance in Krishna Consciousness. So in this way both husband and wife become happy and their lives are sublime. In Krishna Consciousness marriages there is no question of any separation or divorce. Any disagreement between husband and wife is not taken very seriously, as much as a disagreement between children is not taken very seriously. This is because the basic principle of married life in Krishna Consciousness is not whimsical lusts, but it is the eternal principle of rendering devotional service to Krishna.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLetter to Laksmimoni, 10 July, 1969\n</p>\n",

In the end, however, all logic and argument has to be transcended, because neither engender pure devotion. Faith is the only real basis of devotion. Therefore the Srimad-Bhagavatam explains that Sri Krishna, the son of Mother Yashoda, is easily accessible to those who engage in spontaneous—fully faithful—devotional service to Him. Srila Rupa Gosvami therefore says that logic and argument, while important, do not form the safest path to bhakti; rather, like the Srimad-Bhagavatam, he recommends that we follow in the footsteps of the previous acaryas.<br />\n\t(LFD, Vol2, The Process for Awakening Bhakti, Pg 23, 2nd paragraph)\n</p>\n",

However, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura chastised them: “You are not giving to the beggars. You must understand that the Supersoul is within their hearts. When you are giving charity, you are giving to the Lord within the heart.” He went on to explain that even in the temple, whenever a guest comes and whoever he may be, he should be given some food. This is the atithinarayan principle (respecting the uninvited or unscheduled guest as if he were God). However, one should not give food regularly to the same beggars, because then they will simply come for food.

Otherwise, our service becomes mechanical. Our duties are meant to increase our attraction for hearing about Krishna’s activities and pastimes. If we try to remember Krishna while carrying them out, we will gradually become more focused.  There are higher stages of becoming more focused on Krishna. Eventually, we will come to the stage of mantra-upäsana, whereby chanting a mantra or verse from the scripture will remind us of a particular pastime. We will then focus our mind on it and Krishna and His devotees will become fixed in our mind and heart.

The more pronounced our taste, the greater our qualification. If we want to develop taste, then we must show Krishna that we want it. It is not improper to want a taste for spiritual life.

Srila Prabhupada explains in the Bhagavatam that for those who are not liberated, there are two kinds of activities that must be performed—those aimed at maintaining the body and those aimed at achieving liberation. We shouldn't neglect either. If we imitate the liberated souls and neglect the activities that maintain the body, we will fall down; false renunciation does not lead upward. Therefore we should not try to imitate liberated souls but follow in their footsteps. That means that we do have to practice both sadhana as well as duties connected to this world, until we are at least on the liberated platform. This will be impossible without utsaha (enthusiasm). If we have no enthusiasm for our sadhana, we will become negligent in our worship. Negligence is born out of inactivity (laziness), apathy, or indifference. Utsaha conquers all three.<br />\n\t(LFD, Vol2, Enthusiasm for Devotional Service, Pg 33 and 34)   \n</p>\n",

Even though our love in that first stage is obviously not pure, endeavor is an expression of affection. In the first stage of devotional service, devotional service in practice, the living entity accepts a spiritual master and endeavors to follow his instructions and the statements of scripture. As long as one’s love for Krishna remains dormant in the heart, we must first work from a platform of obligation. Srila Prabhupada said, “First there must be obedience. Without obedience there can never be love.” We should begin our endeavors out of obedience. When Krishna sees us making such endeavors, He will bestow love on us through the mercy of His devotees. Those who are obedient to the guru will receive help. As soon as we think we are making advancement on our own, we will lose our qualification to receive pure love.  <br />\n\t(LFD, Vol2, The Process for Awakening Bhakti, Pg 31, last paragraph) \n</p>\n",

But one thing is certain, and that is that the purpose of being in the Krishna Consciousness Movement is to remember Krishna. That's why Srila Prabhupada called this the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. He didn't call it the International Society for Society Consciousness. What's the value of the society if there is no Krishna Consciousness? It's Krishna who gives the society value. Therefore everything we do in this society is meant to help us remember Krishna. That much we should be completely convinced of. If we are convinced of that, we will never be lost. Even if we have to make difficult decisions, even if we have to be inconvenienced, even if we have to confront so many difficulties, we won't be lost. We'll realize that everything is being arranged by Krishna to help us remember Him. (from a lecture given in Moscow on July 26, 2016)\n</p>\n",

But although the distribution of love of God was exceptional during Lord Caitanya’s presence, seeing devotees since then who have truly relished Krishna consciousness in one another’s association has been very attractive to the conditioned souls. When we see genuine Vaisnava exchanges between devotees, we witness real displays of Vaisnava qualities like humility, tolerance, and patience. This is attractive.  Speaking about Vaisnava etiquette, there are many examples of how Lord Caitanya bestowed His mercy on the Vaisnavas and how other Vaisnavas became happy to see it. When we see Vaisnava exchanges that are free from envy and pride, we see the Vaisnavas’ attraction to hearing and chanting about Krishna.

There is a English name, what is called? I forget now. Moralists. The technical name there is. Anyway, this is their point of view, how to avoid God. So I replied that if one is not God conscious, he cannot be moralist, he cannot be truthful, he cannot be honest. This is our point of view. You study the whole world only on these three points, morality, honest, and dutiful. So many nice things are there. But if he's not God conscious, he cannot continue such thing. He must fail. There are so many instances, even amongst the devotees, because this material world is made so that you cannot continue this principle perpetually. That is explained in the Bhagavad-gita, you'll find. Because the three modes of material nature is working, even if you are on the platform of goodness, the other modes of material nature will try to attack you.

Therefore it is offensive to take sides. But Vrndavana dasa Thakura is talking about elevated Vaisnavas, not aparadhis. If you see two advanced Vaisnavas seemingly opposed to one another, consider it lila; don’t become an aparadhi by taking one side over another. And if both are aparadhis and are offending one another by their behavior, then it is still best not to get involved.  However, we have to be careful not to judge that something is an offense when it is actually not. Prabhupäda said that we must speak the truth, calling a spade a spade. The truth is sometimes unpalatable, but we should not refrain from speaking it. But if you see that a person is actually being offensive in their behavior, then “taking sides” may mean that at least you try to get the dispute resolved by someone who can help. Simply taking sides and even starting a defensive movement is not the way to resolve problems. We do not solve problems by numbers or by creating a vox populi. Rather, we should resolve problems from the spiritual platform. Therefore we should look for people who have the most Krishna conscious influence on all parties and place the dispute in their hands.<br />\n\t(LFD, Vol2, Becoming Free from Sin, Pg 43, last paragraph)\n</p>\n",

To the degree that we suffer from such attraction, it will be that much more difficult to fight maya. We require strength. The Mundaka Upanisad (3.2.4) states, “A person devoid of strength in devotional service cannot achieve the Supreme Soul, the Lord. Only one who is eager to practice devotional service through the process of chanting His holy names can enter the supreme abode of the Lord.” We begin to practice devotional service by engaging in activities for Krishna’s satisfaction.  But even to do that we need strength.

That fence is to always keep ourselves in the society of devotees. This fence will protect the seed once it has been planted and has started to grow, and it will keep out mad elephants. Of course, we may ourselves invite mad elephants to trample our creeper—such as when we offend devotees—but the fence will protect us if we prosecute our devotional service carefully.  Once the seed of bhakti is planted, we must water it continuously with hearing and chanting if we want it to grow. While watering, however, we must be careful to pull out any weeds that grow alongside the creeper. That means we have to learn to discriminate between weeds and the devotional plant. The weeds are compared to anarthas, unwanted desires in the heart, that can choke the growing plant. Therefore the most important step one must take in the initial stage of sadhana-bhakti is to associate with those devotees who help us become free from the influence of our anarthas and who strengthen our faith in pure devotional service.  <br />\n\t(LFD, Vol2, Spiritual Strength in Executing Sadhana-bhakti, Pg 49, 1st paragraph)\n</p>\n",

So only Maya’s original source of strength, Krishna, can defeat her.  When Hiranyakasipu asked Prahlada where he got his strength, he said, “My dear father, I have gotten my strength from the same place you have gotten yours.”Because Prahlada got his strength by surrendering to Lord Visnu, he was able to overcome Maya.

Perhaps we are fault-finding, duplicitous, envious of others, or we desire to be worshiped. Or perhaps we are neglecting the instructions of scripture. By looking at our own heart, we should be able to see the truth of our situation.  Even though we may not be able to clearly understand the higher level of nisthita-bhakti, if we want to advance in devotional practices, we have to at least recognize our own anarthas and decide that they should be removed. Otherwise, we are subject to the anartha called tattva-vibhrama (ignorance). That is, we are ignorant of the obstacles we must overcome to make advancement in spiritual life.

So Tamala can spare the balance money for the press at the present moment, and when the house will be actually purchased, Krishna will provide us with the money. Anyway, don't be discouraged.

      "body": "<p>\n\tHow should householders achieve steady faith?<br />\n\tMaharaja Yudhisthira asked this same question of Narada Muni. He said, “I am a grhamudha-dhi, I have the tendency to forget the goal of life, and you are brahmacari. Please, therefore, describe to me the means by which one can achieve salvation in this world according to scriptural descriptions.” Narada Muni gave him the instruction that the householders must hear daily about the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s pastimes in the association of devotees. By hearing about the Lord’s superior activities, the householders will gradually awaken from their dreamlike condition, just as persons gradually wake from their dreams at the end of night. The relationships of this world are simply a perverted reflection of the eternal relationships in the spiritual world, but without hearing about spiritual relationships in relation to Krishna’s pastimes, it’s very hard to understand that. People tend to accept the contents of their dreams as real while they are in the midst of them.  Devotees do not renounce anything that can be engaged in Krishna’s devotional service. Rather, they can care for their families and possessions if they see that by maintaining them the body remains fit for hearing and chanting about Krishna. This will allow them to achieve perfection. It is this striving for perfection that gives householders their impetus to work; it is the root of their enthusiasm, because they know their work will not be a source of misery. As householders live in this way, focused on hearing and chanting about Krishna, their faith increases. It is important that householders adopt activities that increase their faith.<br />\n\t(LFD, Vol2, Faith—The Price for the Holy Name, Pg 97 and Pg 98)\n</p>\n",

Such devotees will surely be promoted to the stage of pure Krishna consciousness. Like Thakur Haridas, the brahmanas who had witnessed his beating, stopped him and expressed their sorrow at the pain he had incurred. However, Haridasa replied, “Why are you lamenting? I deserve to be punished much more than I was. I was taken to prison and I stood there and listened to blasphemy and did not give up my life. Therefore, the Lord was merciful to me! He only gave me a small token of what I should have suffered.”  Before being beaten, Haridasa Thakura had been dragged to prison in chains. Being chained, he was helpless to move even his hands or his legs. Still, Haridasa Thakura accepted the beating as the Lord’s mercy, even though he had been helpless to avoid what he considered his crime—listening to blasphemy and not acting on it. He felt no resentment whatsoever for the punishment he received, but simply accepted it as the complete mercy of the Lord. A devotee has such faith.<br />\n\t(LFD, Vol2, Faith—The Price for the Holy Name, Pg 99 and Pg 100)<br />\n\t \n</p>\n",

Statements about renunciation, austerities, exclusive devotion, or full surrender are theoretical to such persons. Of course, its not that renunciation or austerities or conditional surrender produce prema. In order to be successful in achieving prema-bhakti, devotees must have unflinching faith in the Supreme Lord. The Seventh Canto describes that even though we may be expert in all brahminical activities—we may be religious, moral, detached, humble, tolerant, prepared to offer sacrifices, and know the scriptures—if we are proud of our position and have not surrendered  body, mind, and words to the Supreme Lord, we are considered lower than a person who, although born in a dog-eater family, has completely dedicated everything to Krishna’s service. False brahmanas cannot even purify themselves, what to speak of others, whereas those born in families of dog-eaters but who have surrendered body, mind, and words to the Lord’s service can purify not only themselves but their entire family for generations before and after themselves.  Those who possess such firm faith and who sincerely want to dedicate their lives to serving Krishna are called sraddhavan.<br />\n\t(LFD, Vol2, Faith—The Price for the Holy Name, Pg 100 and Pg 101)<br />\n\t \n</p>\n",

Before we begin chanting, we must first convince ourselves that any thoughts that arise while chanting that are not helping us become more fixed on the holy name are unwanted.

Nonetheless, we must convince ourselves that they are unwanted while we are chanting.  Then we should concentrate simply on hearing the holy name. By hearing continuously very attentively, meditation on the holy name will deepen to meditation on the Lord’s form. While we may now find ourselves meditating more on our service in this world, we should know that there are more elevated levels of service that we can perform that reveal themselves to us when we learn to deeply meditate on Krishna’s name—service such as assisting the Vraja-gopis by perhaps making flower garlands, carrying messages, or some other type of personal service rendered to the Divine Couple. Such elevated meditation cannot be forced.

How does all this fit in with the idea that the holy name should be freely distributed? Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura explains that the Lord’s holy name can be given to anyone. Lord Caitanya Himself did not discriminate in His distribution of Krishna-nama. The holy name can be given to everyone and everyone can chant (think of the disciple who saw the washerwomen, fishermen, and boys chanting the holy name). But to receive nama, initiation, means that one must first follow a process that ultimately awakens one’s faith. And when it is time to accept nama, a follower may offer wealth, words, or intelligence to the spiritual master and the spiritual master may accept it for Gauranga’s service, but all the spiritual master is really seeking is essence: faith.<br />\n\t(LFD, Vol2, Faith—The Price for the Holy Name, Pg 94, 3rd paragraph) \n</p>\n",

Instead of mediatating on difficulties, we should instead think of how to increase our devotional service. It is the nature of the mind to reject difficulty and seek pleasure. If we meet difficulty in one service, we think we will avoid it by taking up another. Or perhaps we decide to give up service altogether, move to another location, or change our association. This does not enable us to contol the mind and senses because mind will always find an excuse to be dissatisfied. The mind is the reservoir of ideas for how to engage in sense gratification. It will never voluntarily surrender to Krishna.<br />\n\tLectures from a disciple Vol 1, Sadhana, Pg 403, last paragraph\n</p>\n",

Book distribution has the unique quality of providing this environment. Granted, sometimes we can become ritualistic in our efforts to sell Krishna conscious literature, and it may seem that we are failing to expand upon the glories of the Lord. But because our efforts are aimed at service to the Vaisnavas, by directly assisting them in spreading the Lord's glories, ultimately we are expanding the Lord's glories. Gradually we can become cured from our diseased condition and begin to develop more and more of an attraction to speak about the Lord in every circumstance.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tCollected Letters: Volume 2, Preaching and Book  Distribution.\n</p>\n",

The example is of Lord Brahma practising meditation upon hearing the syllables \"ta-pa\". The result of Brahma's obedient austerity was that the Lord personally revealed Himself to him and showed him the expanse of the Vaikuntha planets. Because Brahma accepted his guru's discipline, everything was revealed to Him:tene brahma hrda ya adi-kavaye. The point to note is that although Lord Brahma agreed to become disciplined, he did not perform whimsical austerities. The auterities he chose to practise were based upon a superior dictation. The spiritual master is the external manifestation of Supersoul, and he instructs us consistently with the dictations of caitya-guru. By accepting guru's discipline and purifying our existence, we can learn to contact the Lord in the heart.

Therefore I love my body because the part and parcel of Krsna is there. Or you love your body. I love your body. Only for the reason, jivanа sarva-bhutanam - the part and parcel of Krsna is there.

As spiritual beings, we are free, free to act, free to have anything, pure, no contamination, no disease, no birth, no death, no old age, and besides that, we have got many, many other qualifications in our spiritual life.

Our business is to create ideal ksatriyas and vaisyas but beyond that our real business is to keep ourselves as ideal Brahmins. If we are not ideal we cannot create others as ideal. Training is required for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd classes of social constitution. Persons who are not fit for being advanced by training are sudras or less than that. At the present moment in the world state, there are sudras and less than that. There are no ideal brahmanas or ksatriyas. But these four divisions are imperative. So our business is to keep fit as brahmanas and to train others to be ideal ksatriyas and vaisyas for advancing the whole society.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLetter to Rupanuga Maharaja, 28 April, 1974\n</p>\n",

That means that God has His activities, and according to the different types of activities, He has got millions and trillions of name.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLecture on Bhagavad-Gita 7.1, Fiji, 24 May 1975\n</p>\n",

First, it means cultivation through the endeavors to engage and disengage one's body, mind and words. Second, it means cultivation towards the object of our priti, or affection, through manasi-bhava, the sentiments of the heart and mind. Although anusilana is of two types, the cultivation through manasi-bhava is included within cultivation by cesta, one's activities. Hence one's activities or endeavors (cesta) and one's internal sentiments (bhava) are mutually interdependent, and in the end it is the cesta which are concluded to be the sole characteristics of cultivation.

But if the facility for serving the Deities is not there, then we should not be discouraged. This is real detachment. When Caitanya Mahaprabhu was touring all over India He did not bring the Deities with Him.

The process should be in the same way as I have suggested for painting of the pictures. The process is like this. Suppose on Monday you receive the tape number 17, let it be transcribed in two days by someone \"A.'' Then in the next two days (days 3 and 4) someone \"B'' edits it. Then in the next two days (days 5 and 6) another \"C'' edits it for the second time. Then Mr. \"D'' gives it the diacritical marks, and then it is ready for composing. With diacritical marks, one copy should come to me for my record. The idea is that this #17 tape takes 7 days to the point of composition. In the meantime, tape #18 is coming into the process just in the same order. So I receive the final copy of tape #18 just 2 days after receiving tape #17 copy.

It depends upon the spiritual master's transparency.  In the material world, it is the duty of the spiritual master to awaken this service-attitude and to train the disciple in this service-attitude toward the Lord.  It begins by giving relevant instructions for the disciple's progressive advancement in spiritual life.  By following these instructions, the disciple qualifies himself for Krishna's service.  Therefore, serving the spiritual master is essential to become qualified to serve Krishna.  Ultimately we are all servants of Krishna, and everyone has a service according to their particular relationship with Krishna<br />\n\tMKV, Vol 2- Pg 15, (Q/A Meeting With Disciples, Divnomorsk—6/10/01)\n</p>\n",

In other words, anything which is a setback to the realization of Krishna Consciousness is Maya. Anyone who is not in Krishna Consciousness is supposed to be in Maya, and anyone who is in full Krishna Consciousness is out of the clutches of Maya. This is the statements of the Vedic literatures, and we should try to understand and follow the principles.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLetter to Joel Chalson, 22 July, 1969\n</p>\n",

This way we can bargain with them and bring the price down. The psychology behind it is that the Christians will hesitate to tear down a church. They would rather see it still standing. Gradually you should buy all the churches and make them into temples. There are so many churches actually they should give us these churches free, if they were actually God-conscious.

At 5:00 p.m., opening of the door and Dhoop Aratrik as well as Boikalik Bhoga offering. In the morning we offer fruits and milk to the Deities, and at noon we offer rice, dal, capatis, vegetable, milk, sweet rice, and many other varieties. In the Boikalik Bhoga Aratrik we offer fruits again. Then there is Sandhya Aratrik after dusk; and at 9:00 p.m. we offer Bhoga of Puri, vegetable, milk, sweetmeats, etc. Then there is Sandhya Aratrik after which the Deity rests. This is the general program of worship. We decorate the thrones with profuse flowers, changing the dress and ornaments daily, and as far as possible the Deity platform and the Temple room are kept neat and clean always.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tLetter to Bhaiji Hanuman Prasad Poddar, 5 February, 1970\n</p>\n",
