I will first speak about, \"Who is Lord \nBalarama?.\" I will then speak on a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam in which Srila Prabhupada speaks \nabout the necessity of getting spiritual strength from Lord Balarama.\nLord Balarama is the first expansion of Lord Krsna called a svamsa expansion. There's very little \ndifference between Krsna and Balarama. They are both the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nSome of the differences are that is Krsna is blackish like the monsoon raincloud and Balarama is white.\nKrsna plays a flute and Balarama plays a buffalo horn. Sometimes Balarama carries a flute but most \noften He carries a buffalo horn in Vrndavana. Balarama sometimes carries a plow and club.\nBalarama manifested in Vrndavana as Krsna's elder brother. He first appeared in the womb of Devaki \nand later, by the arrangement of Yogamaya, He was transferred to the womb on Rohini. In Vrndavana, \nBalarama is known as Rohininandana, the son of Rohini.\nOutside of Vrndavana, Lord Balarama is manifest as Mula-sankarsana. Mula-sankarsana is the first \nexpansion coming from Lord Balarama. When Lord Balarama appeared in Vrndavana in the womb of \nRohini, this Mula-sankarsana became drawn to Him and appeared within Him. This is explained in \nGopal Campu. Just as Krsna never leaves Vrndavana, Balarama never leaves Vrndavana.\nFrom Lord Balarama manifests His plenary expansions beginning with Mula-sankarsana. As Mula-\nsankarsana, Balarama is manifest outside of Vrndavana in Mathura and Dwaraka.\nFrom Balarama also comes all living entities. Even the nitya-siddhas in the spiritual world, all of \nKrsna's devotees who are either in santa rasa, dasya rasa, sakyha rasa or vatsalya rasa are all coming \nfrom Lord Balarama. Vrndavana is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama. In fact, the whole \ndhama is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama.\nSo Balarama serves Krsna by providing all this for Krsna's pleasure in the spiritual world. Those in \nconjugal rasa, the gopis, are expansions coming from Srimati Radharani.\nIn this way, all of Krsna's eternal associates, Krsna parisada, are manifestations coming from either \nLord Balarama or Srimati Radharani in the spiritual world.\nMula-sankarsana further expands as Maha-sankarsana. As Maha-sankarsana He becomes the source of \nall of the living entities who are serving Krsna in Vaikuntha.\nWhen we say, \"From Lord Balarama comes\", it suggests that at one time, within time, the living entities\nmanifested from Lord Balarama. But we should know that being under the influence of material time, \nthese things are difficult to conceive in the material world.\n\nFor instance, Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita to Arjuna, \"Never was there a time when you did not exist, \nnever was there a time when all these kings assembled in the battlefield did not exist, never was there a \ntime when I did not exist, nor in the future will any of us cease to be.\" (BG 2.12)\nSo when we say that the living entities are all emanations or expansions coming from Lord Balarama, \nimmediately we have a tendency to think, \"Oh at some point in time, they manifested.\" However, they \nare all eternally manifest.\nJust as Krsna, as stated in Brahma Samhita, is beginningless. Lord Brahma says that Krsna is advaitam \nacyutam, anadim, ananta-rupam. He is nondual. His body is never subject to decay. He is the \nbeginning. He has no end. He is the source of everything. So beginningless means, never was there a \ntime when He did not exist.\nIn the same way, never was there a time when Lord Balarama did not exist. Never was there a time \nwhen all of Krsna's eternal associates did not exist, and the living entities, the jivas, never was there a \ntime when they did not exist. Krsna's energies are always existing simultaneously along with Krsna.\nJust like this material world goes through cycles. It's manifest, it stays for some time and then \nunmanifest. But this manifestation and unmanifestation is an eternal process without beginning or end.\nIf I give you a little time to think about it— just a little time. Never was there a time when Krsna, \nBalarama, the living entities did not exist. This cannot be understood by the limited mind. As long as \nwe are under the influence of time, it is very difficult to understand that which is existing in eternal \ntime.\nKrsna says \"the spiritual world is unmanifest, infallible, and it is the supreme destination. When one \ngoes there he never has to come back. \"When Krsna says that the spiritual world is unmanifest, does it \nmean that it doesn't exist? No. Never was there a time when it manifested. It's eternal. And Krsna says \nthat when one goes there, he never comes back. Tad dhama paramam mama. \"That is My supreme \nabode.\" (BG 8.21)\nSo, as we said, Balarama is the first expansion coming from Krsna. But when did Balarama expand \nfrom Krsna? And when did Maha-sankarsana, Mula-sankarsana expand from the original Balarama? \nAnd when from the Mula-sankarsana did Maha-sankarsana manifest in order to manifest the Vaikuntha \nplanets and all of Krsna's servants in the Vaikuntha planets who serve Him in His various forms? We \ncannot say when it happened. We only use those terms because we think in those terms. And we won't \nbe able to fully understand until we go beyond the influence of time ourselves. Those who are beyond \nthe influence of time, for them, time is ever-present. Krsna's pastimes and Balarama's pastimes in the \nspiritual world are eternally manifest.\nTime is also manifest in the spiritual world. But there it exists to assist Krsna and Balarama in Their \npastimes. There is no destructive feature of time in the spiritual world.\nEvery morning, Krsna, Balarama, and Their cowherd boyfriends after breakfast and milking the cows, \ngo out to the pastures. During the day when the sun is fully manifest in the sky, They along with the \ncowherd boys take shelter in the caves of Govardhana. As the sun continues to pass, later in the evening\nKrsna and Balarama with Their cowherd boyfriends and the cows, return to Gokula.\n\n2\nIn the spiritual world, time is manifest just to assist Krsna in His pastimes. But there is no destructive \nfeature of time as time destroys everything in the material world.\nKrsna tells Arjuna when He manifested the universal form, \"kalo 'smi loka-ksaya-krt pravrddho\", Time \nI am, the great destroyer of the worlds.\" (BG 11.32)\nSo when Krsna creates this material world, first He creates time. That's how creation takes place. \nOtherwise how could creation take place if there was no time? So when it's time for unmanifested \nmaterial elements to manifest as the external energy, time first appears.\nThen from Maha-sankarsana, as we said, in the spiritual world comes Karanadakasayi Visnu, who is \nalso a manifestation of Lord Balarama. And from Karandakasayi Visnu comes Garbodakasayi Visnu \nwho enters into each universe, which are generated from Karanadakasayi Visnu. And from \nGarbodakasayi Visnu who lies in the Garbodaka Ocean, comes the first created being in the universe, \nLord Brahma.\nThey are all expansions coming from Lord Balarama. Then there is Ksirodakasayi Visnu, who is also \nthe supersoul, manifested in the heart of all living beings. After the manifestation of Ksirodakasayi \nVisnu, comes Sesa who is a manifestation of the Lord who serves the Lord in various ways in this \nworld.\nAnanta-sesa, on each of His hoods, holds material universes. That's spiritual strength. Imagine holding \nunlimited universes on your hoods, and you standing on nothing? Try to conceive. It's inconceivable.\nSo Ananta-sea is holding all the universes on his different hoods but he rests on nothing. He is self-\nsufficient. And He is a manifestation of Lord Balarama.\nThere are two manifestations of Sesa. There's Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods, and \nthen there is the Ananta-sesa who is the bed of Lord Visnu. In the Laghu-bhagavatamrita Rupa \nGoswami explains that the Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods is an avesa avatara of \nLord Balarama. He is saktyavesa. He's an empowered jiva who holds the universe on his heads as \nAnanta-sesa.\nThe other manifestation of Sesa is a plenary expansion of Lord Balarama upon whom Lord Visnu lies.\nAnanta-sesa serves Lord Krsna, just as Lord Balarama is serving Lord Krsna in all of these different \nforms in the matter of creation and maintenance of this cosmic manifestation. Ananta-sesa is also \nmanifest as Krsna's pillow, Krsna's shoes, Krsna's bed, Krsna's sacred thread, Krsna's garments, etc.. In \nthis way, Ananta-sesa is rendering service to Krsna.\nSo Lord Balarama, in His different manifestations, is rendering service to Krsna in unlimited ways. \nEven though Lord Balarama is Krsna Himself, He is always absorbed in the mood of, \"I am Krsna's \nservant.\"\nLord Balarama's service mood towards Krsna is described as sankula, or mixed. He is Krsna's friend. \nKrsna goes out with his cowherd boyfriends. Lord Balarama is going with Him into the pasturing \n\ngrounds. He's Krsna's servant as we already described in various ways how Lord Balarama renders \nservice to Krsna. And He also has a mood of vatsalya, because He is Krsna's older brother.\nIn Vedic culture, ancient culture, the older brother is always worshipped and respected as one's \nsuperior. So Balarama also has this vatsalya mood of protecting Krsna.\nWhen Balarama and Krsna entered into the forest of Dhenukasura, Krsna spoke about Lord Balarama \nas follows:\n\"O greatest of Lords, just see how these trees are bowing their heads at Your lotus feet, which are \nworshipable by the immortal demigods. The trees are offering You their fruits and flowers to eradicate \nthe dark ignorance that has caused their birth as trees.\" (SB 10.15.5)\nSo Krsna is considering Balarama His superior. In the forest of Dhenukasura, Balarama is lying down \nwith His head on the lap of the cowherd boys and Krsna is taking Balarama's lotus feet and is \nmassaging them. So Balarama also serves Krsna in this vatsalya mood and is treated as a superior by \nKrsna. Balarama also serves Krsna in madhurya-rasa. But to do that, He is manifested as Ananga-\nmanjari, the sister of Radharani.\nBalarama is also considered Adi-guru. Adi-guru means the original guru. Just as Krsna treats Balarama \nas a superior, He also treats Him as guru. Balarama is akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda means unlimited. \nIn other words, Balarama is the guru that manifests in unlimited forms to serve as guru. And all gurus \nare understood to be representatives of Lord Balarama, who is the source of spiritual strength.\nPrabhupada explains in Krsna book. \"In the Upanisad it is stated, nayam atma bala-hinena labhyah. The\npurport is that one cannot attain the supreme platform of self-realization without being sufficiently \nfavored by Balarama. Bala does not mean physical strength. No one can attain spiritual perfection by \nphysical strength. One must have the spiritual strength which is infused by Balarama, or Sankarsana. \nAnanta, or Sesa, is the power which sustains all the planets in their different positions. Materially this \nsustaining power is known as the law of gravitation, but actually it is a display of the potency of \nSankarsana. Balarama, or Sankarsana, is spiritual power, or the original spiritual master. Therefore \nLord Nityananda Prabhu, who is also the incarnation of Balarama, is the original spiritual master. And \nthe spiritual master is the representative of Balarama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who \nsupplies spiritual strength. In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is confirmed that the spiritual master is the \nmanifestation of the mercy of Krsna.\" (Krsna Book Ch. 2)\nSo Prabhupada refers to the verse from the Mundaka Upanisad.\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvan\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nThis verse means, \"The Supreme Lord cannot be attained by one who has no spiritual strength, one \nwho is careless or wild, or whose austerites are inappropriate. The Lord appears before a person who \nstrives by the right means to attain Him. Such a person enters the spiritual world.\"\n\nOne requires spiritual strength in order to understand Krsna and to enter the spiritual world. \nPrabhupada says that we are not talking about physical strength. Spiritual strength is the strength to \novercome the influence of the modes of material nature, to cross the ocean of material existence, and to\nbecome qualified to enter into that supreme abode which is unmanifest and infallible.\nWho is the source of spiritual strength? It is Balarama who is akhanda guru tattva. He manifests \nHimself in various forms in order to give strength to the living entities in the material world so they can\nfind the determination, courage, and satisfaction to overcome the stringent laws of material nature and \nto achieve entrance into that eternal abode.\nAs the Mundaka Upanisad says, \"Krsna manifests Himself to that person who strives to achieve Him \nby the right means.\" What is the right means?\nThat is the verse we wanted to read today from Srimad Bhagavatam. This verse speaks about the right \nmeans to cross the ocean of material existence, by getting strength from the spiritual master and \npredecessor spiritual masters.\nHow can we overcome the illusory energy by our own strength? A devotee never thinks, \"I am \nspiritually strong by my own endeavors.\" He knows that whatever spiritual strength he has, has been \ngiven to him because he is taking shelter of spiritual strength.\nJust as one takes shelter of Krsna consciousness,\nkrsna -- surya-sama, maya haya andhakara\nyahan krsna, tahan nahi mayara adhikara\n\"Krsna is compared to sunshine, and maya is compared to darkness. Wherever there is sunshine, there \ncannot be darkness. As soon as one takes to Krsna consciousness, the darkness of illusion (the influence\nof the external energy) will immediately vanish. (Madhya 22.31)\nWherever there is Krsna, there cannot be maya. Wherever there is Krsna consciousness, there cannot be\nthe influence of illusion. But we cannot manifest Krsna before us by our own strength.\nSrimad Bhagavatam states:\nathapi te deva padambuja-dvaya-\nprasada-lesanugrhita eva hi\njanati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno\nna canya eko 'pi ciram vicinvan\nMy Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the \ngreatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years. (SB \n10.14.29)\nUnless one gets that drop of mercy he cannot understand.\n3\nKrsna tells Arjuna,\n\nMy dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before \nyou, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My \nunderstanding. (Bg 11.54)\nTherefore the knowledge and strength to cross over the material existence is coming from Krsna and \nBalarama. Balarama is Adi-guru, the original guru, He is the original source of all spiritual strength. If \none wishes to get spiritual strength, he must take shelter of guru and as this verse we are going to read \ntoday says, our predecessor gurus.\nSo this is the verse and purport that I am going to read in this connection. It's the 7th Canto of Srimad \nBhagavatam, 15th chapter, 45th verse.\nyavan nr-kaya-ratham atma-vasopakalpam\ndhatte garistha-caranarcanaya nisatam\njnanasim acyuta-balo dadhad asta-satruh\nsvananda-tusta upasanta idam vijahyat\nTRANSLATION\nAs long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and paraphernalia, which are \nnot fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, namely his spiritual \nmaster and the spiritual master's predecessors. By their mercy, one can sharpen the sword of \nknowledge, and with the power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's mercy one must then \nconquer the enemies mentioned above. In this way, the devotee should be able to merge into his \nown transcendental bliss, and then he may give up his body and resume his spiritual identity.\nThis verse refers to the enemies mentioned in the previous verse. So in order to more fully understand \nwhat this verse is talking about one should know what these enemies are. And this is the previous verse.\nIn the conditioned stage, one's conceptions of life are sometimes polluted by passion and \nignorance, which are exhibited by attachment, hostility, greed, lamentation, illusion, fear, \nmadness, false prestige, insults, fault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, \nbewilderment, hunger and sleep. All of these are enemies. Sometimes one's conceptions are also \npolluted by goodness. (SB 7.15.43–44)\nIs there anyone who thinks that these enemies that we've listed have all been conquered? I'll read them \none more time.\nAttachment. One by one. Hostility. Greed. Lamentation, illusion, fear, madness, false prestige, insult, \nfault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, bewilderment, hunger, sleep. All of these are \nenemies.\nBy the strength of our own intelligence, to some degree, we may be able to deal with some of these \nenemies. But Prabhupada is going to make the point very clear in the purport that simply by knowledge\nitself one cannot cut away from these enemies.\nKrsna says clearly that the living entities in the material world are struggling very hard with material \nexistence. None of us can say, \"I'm not struggling with these things.\".\n\nOftentimes devotees ask me how to deal with the fact that they are struggling with Krsna \nconsciousness. I say to them, \"You're struggling?! It's good that you're struggling. As soon as you stop \nstruggling you're finished.\" If we're struggling it means that we want to overcome these bad influences. \nThose who don't want to overcome them, think it's natural to be lusty. It's natural to be envious. They \ndon't think they are in illusion because they think illusion is reality.\nWe should therefore struggle to find the spiritual strength to overcome these enemies. That much \nstruggling we have to do. If we don't struggle for that, we'll have to struggle with material nature, \nwhich is very hard on the living entity, and causes so much anxiety.\nPrabhupada says that this material world is kuntha. It is a place of anxiety. It cannot be avoided. \nEverything in this world is temporary and the eternal living entity is going to have to be in anxiety \nabout losing that which he is attached to. So he struggles with this illusory energy.\nA devotee therefore prays. \"Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare/ Hare Rama Hare Rama \nRama Rama Hare Hare.\" He's praying to Krsna. He's praying to Lord Balarama. \"Please give me the \nstrength so that I may be engaged in Krsna's service.\" He's praying to Srimati Radharani. Please engage\nme in Krsna's service. He's looking for strength. This is his struggle.\nSo just as this verse states that \"As long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and\nparaphernalia, which are not fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, \nnamely his spiritual master and the spiritual master's predecessors.\"\nSo let me read the purport. Please take note of the emphasis Srila Prabhupada is making about strength.\nIt's a little bit long. Try to listen carefully.\nIn Bhagavad-gita (4.9) the Lord says:\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\" This is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\nIn other words, this is what it means to accept help from the superiors is to go back home, back to \nGodhead. This is the destination that Krsna wants all living entities to achieve. And Lord Balarama and\nthose in the line of Lord Balarama are meant to give us the strength to go back to the spiritual world.\nThis is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\n... to go back home, back to Godhead.\nIt is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.20.17):\nnr-deham adyam sulabham sudurlabham\nplavam sukalpam guru-karnadharam\n\nmayanukulena nabhasvateritam\npuman bhavabdhim na taret sa atma-ha\nThis human form of body is a most valuable boat, and the spiritual master is the captain, guru-\nkarnadharam, to guide the boat in plying across the ocean of nescience. The instruction of Krsna \nis a favorable breeze. One must use all these facilities to cross over the ocean of nescience. Since \nthe spiritual master is the captain, one must serve the spiritual master very sincerely so that by his\nmercy one will be able to get the mercy of the Supreme Lord.\nA significant word here is acyuta-balah. The spiritual master is certainly very merciful to his \ndisciples, and consequently by satisfying him a devotee gets strength from the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore says, guru-krsna-prasade paya \nbhakti-lata-bija: [Cc. Madhya 19.151] one must first please the spiritual master, and then one \nautomatically pleases Krsna and gets the strength with which to cross the ocean of nescience.\nThis is the point I was making before. Simply knowledge, is insufficient. One can study the Vedas for \nmillions of births, as Lord Brahma says in Brahma Samhita, and still never be able to understand \nKrsna. So it's not simply by knowledge that one can cross the ocean of material existence.\nThe purport continues:\nIf one seriously desires to return home, back to Godhead, one must therefore become strong \nenough by pleasing the spiritual master, for thus one gets the weapon with which to conquer the \nenemy, and one also gets the grace of Krsna. Simply getting the weapon of jnana is insufficient. \nOne must sharpen the weapon by serving the spiritual master and adhering to his instructions. \nThen the candidate will get the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nPrabhupada then gives a nice analogy.\nIn general warfare one must take help from his chariot and horses in order to conquer his enemy, \nand after conquering his enemies he may give up the chariot and its paraphernalia. Similarly, as \nlong as one has a human body, one should fully use it to obtain the highest perfection of life, \nnamely going back home, back to Godhead.\nUsing the human form of life to its full potential.\nkamasya nendriya-pritir\nlabho jiveta yavata\njivasya tattva-jijnasa\nnartho yas ceha karmabhih\nLife's desires should never be directed toward sense gratification. One should desire only a healthy life,\nor self-preservation, since a human being is meant for inquiry about the Absolute Truth. Nothing else \nshould be the goal of one's works. (SB 1.2.10)\nThe perfection of knowledge is certainly to become transcendentally situated (brahma-bhuta [SB \n4.30.20]). As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):\n\nbrahma-bhutah prasannatma\nna socati na kanksati\nsamah sarvesu bhutesu\nmad-bhaktim labhate param\n\"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully \njoyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living \nentities. In that state he attains pure devotional service.\" Simply by cultivating knowledge as the \nimpersonalists do, one cannot get out of the clutches of maya. One must attain the platform of \nbhakti.\nbhaktya mam abhijanati\nyavan yas casmi tattvatah\ntato mam tattvato jnatva\nvisate tad-anantaram\n\"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one \nis in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of \nGod.\" (Bg. 18.55) Unless one has attained the stage of devotional service and the mercy of the \nspiritual master and Krsna, there is a possibility that one may fall down and again accept a \nmaterial body. Therefore Krsna stresses in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\"\nThe word tattvatah, meaning \"in reality,\" is very important. Tato mam tattvato jnatva. Unless one \nunderstands Krsna in truth by the mercy of the spiritual master, one is not free to give up his \nmaterial body.\nIn other words, one has to accept another material body.\n4\nAs it is said, aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah: [SB \n10.2.32] if one neglects to serve the lotus feet of Krsna, one cannot become free from the material\nclutches simply by knowledge. Even if one attains the stage of brahma-padam, merging in \nBrahman, without bhakti he is prone to fall down. One must be very careful in regard to the \ndanger of falling down again into material bondage. The only insurance is to come to the stage of \nbhakti, from which one is sure not to fall. Then one is free from the activities of the material \nworld. In summary, as stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, one must get in touch with a bona fide\nspiritual master coming in the parampara of Krsna consciousness, for by his mercy and \n\ninstructions one is able to get strength from Krsna. Thus one engages in devotional service and \nattains the ultimate goal of life, the lotus feet of Visnu.\nSignificant in this verse are the words jnanasim acyuta-balah. Jnanasim, the sword of knowledge, \nis given by Krsna, and when one serves the guru and Krsna in order to hold the sword of Krsna's \ninstructions, Balarama gives one strength. Balarama is Nityananda. Vrajendra-nandana yei, saci-\nsuta haila sei, balarama ha-ila nitai. This bala -- Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya \nMahaprabhu, and both of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take \nshelter of Their lotus feet. They come especially to deliver the fallen souls of this age, papi tapi \nyata chila, hari-name uddharila. Their weapon is sankirtana, hari-nama. Thus one should accept \nthe sword of knowledge from Krsna and be strong with the mercy of Balarama. We are therefore \nworshiping Krsna-Balarama in Vrndavana. In the Mundaka Upanisad (3.2.4) it is said:\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvams\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nOne cannot attain the goal of life without the mercy of Balarama. Sri Narottama dasa Thakura \ntherefore says, nitaiyera karuna habe, vraje radha-krsna pabe: when one receives the mercy of \nBalarama, Nityananda, one can attain the lotus feet of Radha and Krsna very easily.\nse sambandha nahi yara,   \nbrtha janma gela tara,\nvidya-kule hi karibe tara\nIf one has no connection with Nitai, Balarama, then even though one is a very learned scholar or \njnani or has taken birth in a very respectable family, these assets will not help him. We must \ntherefore conquer the enemies of Krsna consciousness with the strength received from Balarama. \n[end of purport]\nThese enemies are like whips. They are beating us again and again, keeping us in the bodily \nidentification. Imagine living with enemies. We are living with enemies right in our own bodies.\nKrsna described the enemy as lust. When Arjuna asked Krsna, \"What is it Krsna that compels a person \nto act even against his own will?\" Krsna replied that \"It's lust only Arjuna which is later transformed in \nanger, which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world.\" How to conquer this enemy on our own \nstrength?\nThose who try to do it on the strength of their own intelligence,\ntvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\n (SB 10.2.32)\n\n[...]their intelligence is impure. They fall down from their position of imagined superiority because \nthey have no regard for Your lotus feet.\nThey are destined to fall, because they haven't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus feet. They haven't taken \nshelter of Lord Balarama. They haven't taken shelter of bhakti, which manifests through the mercy of \nthe spiritual and the predecessor spiritual masters.\nThe spiritual master must represent the predecessor spiritual masters. Only by representing the \npredecessor spiritual master can one strive to achieve the Lord by the right means.\nThe verse nayam atma bala hinena labhyo clearly states that one has to achieve the Lord by the right \nmeans. One should not be wild or careless. By the right means Krsna reveals Himself and one enters \nthe spiritual world.\n5\nThis is the meaning of akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda guru tattva means that Lord Balarama manifests \nHimself as guru in an unlimited variety of forms. And it is the service of guru to give one the strength \nto cross over the ocean of material existence to enter into the spiritual world.\nSo this is how we worship Lord Balarama on His appearance day. We should know that He is adi-guru. \nHe is the original guru and and all other gurus represent Him. Without His mercy, without taking \nshelter of Him, we will never be able to give up this sense gratification and attachment to the material \nworld.\nAs described in the song Gauranga Bolite Ha'be, Narottama das Thakur is praying.\nara kabe nitai-candera karuna karibe\nsamsara-vasana mora kabe tuccha habe\n\"When will Lord Nityananda have mercy upon me so that I can realize the uselessness of material \npleasure?'\nHe is praying in that way. Who is Nityananda? He is Lord Balarama. Nityananda is the same as Lord \nBalarama. He has appeared to serve Lord Caitanya in the same way as Lord Balarama has appeared to \nserve Lord Krsna.\nAnd as Prabhupada says in today's purport, \"Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and \nboth of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take shelter of Their lotus \nfeet.\"\nWhat is their weapon?\nkrsna-varnam tvisakrsnam\nsangopangastra-parsadam\nSB 11.5.32\nThe verse describes how Lord Caitanya appears with His weapons. What is Lord Caitanya's weapon? \nHe's not coming to chop off heads. Not coming with a club to beat and destroy. He's coming with the \nweapon of harinama sankirtan. That is the weapon He has come with in this age of Kali.\n\nSrila Bhaktisiddhanti Sarasvati Thakur describes in one article of the Harmonist Magazine.\n\"Nityananda alone possesses the distinctive function of the guru. In Nityananda the function is \nembodied. Nityananda is the servant-God. He serves Sri Gaurasundara by the distinctive method of \nreverential servitude. He is identical with Sri Balarama of krsna-lila.[...]\n[...]\"But Nityananda does not directly instruct in the confidential service of Krsna. Srimati Radhika is \nthe guru of the inner circle of the servants of Krsna. Srimati Radhika, however, accepts the offer of \nservice of only those souls who are specially favored by Nityananda and are deemed by Him to be fit \nfor Her service.\nSo in all respects we are dependent upon the mercy of Nityananda Balarama to become qualifided to \ndance in the spiritual world and to be fully engaged in loving devotional service to the Lord.\nThis is the goal. Prabhupada clearly states this right from the outset of the verse. The goal is to go back \nhome, back to Godhead. The goal is not to be happy in this material world.\nThe devotee who understands this goal may become happy in this world. But as Rupa Goswami says, \nthere is three types of happiness. 1) Happiness derived from sense gratification, which is temporary. 2) \nHappiness which comes from liberation, which can also be temporary.\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\nOne will fall down from his position of imagined superiority if he hasn't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus \nfeet. And 3) The happiness which comes from bhakti, by realizing\njivera 'svarupa' haya -- krsnera 'nitya-dasa'\nI am Krsna's eternal servant, and my only business in life is to find shelter at His lotus feet. This is real \nhappiness.\nBy the mercy of guru, by the mercy of predecessor gurus, and by the mercy of Lord Balarama. This is \nwhat it means to take shelter. And this is why we observe Lord Balarama's appearance day... to pray for\nthis strength.\nHare Krsna","attachment_name":"balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf","attachment_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/sites/default/files/attachments/balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf"},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"ru":{"title":"26 августа, 2018 - Алматы, Казахстан - Лекция на Баларама Пурниме - Английский/ Русский","event":"Festival","topic":"Шримад Бхагаватам","translation":"Русский","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"","attachment_name":""},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"counters":{"audio_page_view":0,"audio_play_count":0,"downloads":"147","video_page_view":0,"en_transcription_view":0,"ru_transcription_view":0,"en_summary_view":0,"ru_summary_view":0}},{"uuid":"1f8bcffa-5bd8-42c3-b89d-081bfb0e3fe4","needs_translation":true,"created_date":"2018-08-26","published_date":"","author":"Niranjana Swami","part":"7","chapter":"15","verse":"45","download_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/download/33355","lecture_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/en/lecture/26495","duration":"01:37:59","downloads":"147","audio_link":"https://nrs-site.s3.amazonaws.com/lectures/2018/2018-08/niranjana_swami_-_sb_7.15.45_on_balarama-purnima_-c2a0almaty_26-aug-2018.mp3","soundCloud_link":"https://soundcloud.com/niranjana-swami/august-26-2018-almaty","youtube":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsg2S32qsdM?rel=gallery-all&wmode=opaque&autoplay=0"],"en":{"title":"August 26, 2018 - Almaty, Kazakhstan - Balarama Purnima Class - English/ Russian","event":"Festival","topic":"Srimad Bhagavatam","translation":"Russian","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"\n\nTranscription of a Lecture Given on Balarama Purnima, August 26, 2018, in Almaty, Kazakhstan\nThe following is a partially-edited lecture given in Almaty, Kazakhstan on Balarama Purnima, August \n26, 2018\nToday we are observing the appearance of Lord Balarama. I will first speak about, \"Who is Lord \nBalarama?.\" I will then speak on a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam in which Srila Prabhupada speaks \nabout the necessity of getting spiritual strength from Lord Balarama.\nLord Balarama is the first expansion of Lord Krsna called a svamsa expansion. There's very little \ndifference between Krsna and Balarama. They are both the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nSome of the differences are that is Krsna is blackish like the monsoon raincloud and Balarama is white.\nKrsna plays a flute and Balarama plays a buffalo horn. Sometimes Balarama carries a flute but most \noften He carries a buffalo horn in Vrndavana. Balarama sometimes carries a plow and club.\nBalarama manifested in Vrndavana as Krsna's elder brother. He first appeared in the womb of Devaki \nand later, by the arrangement of Yogamaya, He was transferred to the womb on Rohini. In Vrndavana, \nBalarama is known as Rohininandana, the son of Rohini.\nOutside of Vrndavana, Lord Balarama is manifest as Mula-sankarsana. Mula-sankarsana is the first \nexpansion coming from Lord Balarama. When Lord Balarama appeared in Vrndavana in the womb of \nRohini, this Mula-sankarsana became drawn to Him and appeared within Him. This is explained in \nGopal Campu. Just as Krsna never leaves Vrndavana, Balarama never leaves Vrndavana.\nFrom Lord Balarama manifests His plenary expansions beginning with Mula-sankarsana. As Mula-\nsankarsana, Balarama is manifest outside of Vrndavana in Mathura and Dwaraka.\nFrom Balarama also comes all living entities. Even the nitya-siddhas in the spiritual world, all of \nKrsna's devotees who are either in santa rasa, dasya rasa, sakyha rasa or vatsalya rasa are all coming \nfrom Lord Balarama. Vrndavana is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama. In fact, the whole \ndhama is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama.\nSo Balarama serves Krsna by providing all this for Krsna's pleasure in the spiritual world. Those in \nconjugal rasa, the gopis, are expansions coming from Srimati Radharani.\nIn this way, all of Krsna's eternal associates, Krsna parisada, are manifestations coming from either \nLord Balarama or Srimati Radharani in the spiritual world.\nMula-sankarsana further expands as Maha-sankarsana. As Maha-sankarsana He becomes the source of \nall of the living entities who are serving Krsna in Vaikuntha.\nWhen we say, \"From Lord Balarama comes\", it suggests that at one time, within time, the living entities\nmanifested from Lord Balarama. But we should know that being under the influence of material time, \nthese things are difficult to conceive in the material world.\n\nFor instance, Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita to Arjuna, \"Never was there a time when you did not exist, \nnever was there a time when all these kings assembled in the battlefield did not exist, never was there a \ntime when I did not exist, nor in the future will any of us cease to be.\" (BG 2.12)\nSo when we say that the living entities are all emanations or expansions coming from Lord Balarama, \nimmediately we have a tendency to think, \"Oh at some point in time, they manifested.\" However, they \nare all eternally manifest.\nJust as Krsna, as stated in Brahma Samhita, is beginningless. Lord Brahma says that Krsna is advaitam \nacyutam, anadim, ananta-rupam. He is nondual. His body is never subject to decay. He is the \nbeginning. He has no end. He is the source of everything. So beginningless means, never was there a \ntime when He did not exist.\nIn the same way, never was there a time when Lord Balarama did not exist. Never was there a time \nwhen all of Krsna's eternal associates did not exist, and the living entities, the jivas, never was there a \ntime when they did not exist. Krsna's energies are always existing simultaneously along with Krsna.\nJust like this material world goes through cycles. It's manifest, it stays for some time and then \nunmanifest. But this manifestation and unmanifestation is an eternal process without beginning or end.\nIf I give you a little time to think about it— just a little time. Never was there a time when Krsna, \nBalarama, the living entities did not exist. This cannot be understood by the limited mind. As long as \nwe are under the influence of time, it is very difficult to understand that which is existing in eternal \ntime.\nKrsna says \"the spiritual world is unmanifest, infallible, and it is the supreme destination. When one \ngoes there he never has to come back. \"When Krsna says that the spiritual world is unmanifest, does it \nmean that it doesn't exist? No. Never was there a time when it manifested. It's eternal. And Krsna says \nthat when one goes there, he never comes back. Tad dhama paramam mama. \"That is My supreme \nabode.\" (BG 8.21)\nSo, as we said, Balarama is the first expansion coming from Krsna. But when did Balarama expand \nfrom Krsna? And when did Maha-sankarsana, Mula-sankarsana expand from the original Balarama? \nAnd when from the Mula-sankarsana did Maha-sankarsana manifest in order to manifest the Vaikuntha \nplanets and all of Krsna's servants in the Vaikuntha planets who serve Him in His various forms? We \ncannot say when it happened. We only use those terms because we think in those terms. And we won't \nbe able to fully understand until we go beyond the influence of time ourselves. Those who are beyond \nthe influence of time, for them, time is ever-present. Krsna's pastimes and Balarama's pastimes in the \nspiritual world are eternally manifest.\nTime is also manifest in the spiritual world. But there it exists to assist Krsna and Balarama in Their \npastimes. There is no destructive feature of time in the spiritual world.\nEvery morning, Krsna, Balarama, and Their cowherd boyfriends after breakfast and milking the cows, \ngo out to the pastures. During the day when the sun is fully manifest in the sky, They along with the \ncowherd boys take shelter in the caves of Govardhana. As the sun continues to pass, later in the evening\nKrsna and Balarama with Their cowherd boyfriends and the cows, return to Gokula.\n\n2\nIn the spiritual world, time is manifest just to assist Krsna in His pastimes. But there is no destructive \nfeature of time as time destroys everything in the material world.\nKrsna tells Arjuna when He manifested the universal form, \"kalo 'smi loka-ksaya-krt pravrddho\", Time \nI am, the great destroyer of the worlds.\" (BG 11.32)\nSo when Krsna creates this material world, first He creates time. That's how creation takes place. \nOtherwise how could creation take place if there was no time? So when it's time for unmanifested \nmaterial elements to manifest as the external energy, time first appears.\nThen from Maha-sankarsana, as we said, in the spiritual world comes Karanadakasayi Visnu, who is \nalso a manifestation of Lord Balarama. And from Karandakasayi Visnu comes Garbodakasayi Visnu \nwho enters into each universe, which are generated from Karanadakasayi Visnu. And from \nGarbodakasayi Visnu who lies in the Garbodaka Ocean, comes the first created being in the universe, \nLord Brahma.\nThey are all expansions coming from Lord Balarama. Then there is Ksirodakasayi Visnu, who is also \nthe supersoul, manifested in the heart of all living beings. After the manifestation of Ksirodakasayi \nVisnu, comes Sesa who is a manifestation of the Lord who serves the Lord in various ways in this \nworld.\nAnanta-sesa, on each of His hoods, holds material universes. That's spiritual strength. Imagine holding \nunlimited universes on your hoods, and you standing on nothing? Try to conceive. It's inconceivable.\nSo Ananta-sea is holding all the universes on his different hoods but he rests on nothing. He is self-\nsufficient. And He is a manifestation of Lord Balarama.\nThere are two manifestations of Sesa. There's Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods, and \nthen there is the Ananta-sesa who is the bed of Lord Visnu. In the Laghu-bhagavatamrita Rupa \nGoswami explains that the Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods is an avesa avatara of \nLord Balarama. He is saktyavesa. He's an empowered jiva who holds the universe on his heads as \nAnanta-sesa.\nThe other manifestation of Sesa is a plenary expansion of Lord Balarama upon whom Lord Visnu lies.\nAnanta-sesa serves Lord Krsna, just as Lord Balarama is serving Lord Krsna in all of these different \nforms in the matter of creation and maintenance of this cosmic manifestation. Ananta-sesa is also \nmanifest as Krsna's pillow, Krsna's shoes, Krsna's bed, Krsna's sacred thread, Krsna's garments, etc.. In \nthis way, Ananta-sesa is rendering service to Krsna.\nSo Lord Balarama, in His different manifestations, is rendering service to Krsna in unlimited ways. \nEven though Lord Balarama is Krsna Himself, He is always absorbed in the mood of, \"I am Krsna's \nservant.\"\nLord Balarama's service mood towards Krsna is described as sankula, or mixed. He is Krsna's friend. \nKrsna goes out with his cowherd boyfriends. Lord Balarama is going with Him into the pasturing \n\ngrounds. He's Krsna's servant as we already described in various ways how Lord Balarama renders \nservice to Krsna. And He also has a mood of vatsalya, because He is Krsna's older brother.\nIn Vedic culture, ancient culture, the older brother is always worshipped and respected as one's \nsuperior. So Balarama also has this vatsalya mood of protecting Krsna.\nWhen Balarama and Krsna entered into the forest of Dhenukasura, Krsna spoke about Lord Balarama \nas follows:\n\"O greatest of Lords, just see how these trees are bowing their heads at Your lotus feet, which are \nworshipable by the immortal demigods. The trees are offering You their fruits and flowers to eradicate \nthe dark ignorance that has caused their birth as trees.\" (SB 10.15.5)\nSo Krsna is considering Balarama His superior. In the forest of Dhenukasura, Balarama is lying down \nwith His head on the lap of the cowherd boys and Krsna is taking Balarama's lotus feet and is \nmassaging them. So Balarama also serves Krsna in this vatsalya mood and is treated as a superior by \nKrsna. Balarama also serves Krsna in madhurya-rasa. But to do that, He is manifested as Ananga-\nmanjari, the sister of Radharani.\nBalarama is also considered Adi-guru. Adi-guru means the original guru. Just as Krsna treats Balarama \nas a superior, He also treats Him as guru. Balarama is akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda means unlimited. \nIn other words, Balarama is the guru that manifests in unlimited forms to serve as guru. And all gurus \nare understood to be representatives of Lord Balarama, who is the source of spiritual strength.\nPrabhupada explains in Krsna book. \"In the Upanisad it is stated, nayam atma bala-hinena labhyah. The\npurport is that one cannot attain the supreme platform of self-realization without being sufficiently \nfavored by Balarama. Bala does not mean physical strength. No one can attain spiritual perfection by \nphysical strength. One must have the spiritual strength which is infused by Balarama, or Sankarsana. \nAnanta, or Sesa, is the power which sustains all the planets in their different positions. Materially this \nsustaining power is known as the law of gravitation, but actually it is a display of the potency of \nSankarsana. Balarama, or Sankarsana, is spiritual power, or the original spiritual master. Therefore \nLord Nityananda Prabhu, who is also the incarnation of Balarama, is the original spiritual master. And \nthe spiritual master is the representative of Balarama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who \nsupplies spiritual strength. In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is confirmed that the spiritual master is the \nmanifestation of the mercy of Krsna.\" (Krsna Book Ch. 2)\nSo Prabhupada refers to the verse from the Mundaka Upanisad.\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvan\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nThis verse means, \"The Supreme Lord cannot be attained by one who has no spiritual strength, one \nwho is careless or wild, or whose austerites are inappropriate. The Lord appears before a person who \nstrives by the right means to attain Him. Such a person enters the spiritual world.\"\n\nOne requires spiritual strength in order to understand Krsna and to enter the spiritual world. \nPrabhupada says that we are not talking about physical strength. Spiritual strength is the strength to \novercome the influence of the modes of material nature, to cross the ocean of material existence, and to\nbecome qualified to enter into that supreme abode which is unmanifest and infallible.\nWho is the source of spiritual strength? It is Balarama who is akhanda guru tattva. He manifests \nHimself in various forms in order to give strength to the living entities in the material world so they can\nfind the determination, courage, and satisfaction to overcome the stringent laws of material nature and \nto achieve entrance into that eternal abode.\nAs the Mundaka Upanisad says, \"Krsna manifests Himself to that person who strives to achieve Him \nby the right means.\" What is the right means?\nThat is the verse we wanted to read today from Srimad Bhagavatam. This verse speaks about the right \nmeans to cross the ocean of material existence, by getting strength from the spiritual master and \npredecessor spiritual masters.\nHow can we overcome the illusory energy by our own strength? A devotee never thinks, \"I am \nspiritually strong by my own endeavors.\" He knows that whatever spiritual strength he has, has been \ngiven to him because he is taking shelter of spiritual strength.\nJust as one takes shelter of Krsna consciousness,\nkrsna -- surya-sama, maya haya andhakara\nyahan krsna, tahan nahi mayara adhikara\n\"Krsna is compared to sunshine, and maya is compared to darkness. Wherever there is sunshine, there \ncannot be darkness. As soon as one takes to Krsna consciousness, the darkness of illusion (the influence\nof the external energy) will immediately vanish. (Madhya 22.31)\nWherever there is Krsna, there cannot be maya. Wherever there is Krsna consciousness, there cannot be\nthe influence of illusion. But we cannot manifest Krsna before us by our own strength.\nSrimad Bhagavatam states:\nathapi te deva padambuja-dvaya-\nprasada-lesanugrhita eva hi\njanati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno\nna canya eko 'pi ciram vicinvan\nMy Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the \ngreatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years. (SB \n10.14.29)\nUnless one gets that drop of mercy he cannot understand.\n3\nKrsna tells Arjuna,\n\nMy dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before \nyou, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My \nunderstanding. (Bg 11.54)\nTherefore the knowledge and strength to cross over the material existence is coming from Krsna and \nBalarama. Balarama is Adi-guru, the original guru, He is the original source of all spiritual strength. If \none wishes to get spiritual strength, he must take shelter of guru and as this verse we are going to read \ntoday says, our predecessor gurus.\nSo this is the verse and purport that I am going to read in this connection. It's the 7th Canto of Srimad \nBhagavatam, 15th chapter, 45th verse.\nyavan nr-kaya-ratham atma-vasopakalpam\ndhatte garistha-caranarcanaya nisatam\njnanasim acyuta-balo dadhad asta-satruh\nsvananda-tusta upasanta idam vijahyat\nTRANSLATION\nAs long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and paraphernalia, which are \nnot fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, namely his spiritual \nmaster and the spiritual master's predecessors. By their mercy, one can sharpen the sword of \nknowledge, and with the power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's mercy one must then \nconquer the enemies mentioned above. In this way, the devotee should be able to merge into his \nown transcendental bliss, and then he may give up his body and resume his spiritual identity.\nThis verse refers to the enemies mentioned in the previous verse. So in order to more fully understand \nwhat this verse is talking about one should know what these enemies are. And this is the previous verse.\nIn the conditioned stage, one's conceptions of life are sometimes polluted by passion and \nignorance, which are exhibited by attachment, hostility, greed, lamentation, illusion, fear, \nmadness, false prestige, insults, fault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, \nbewilderment, hunger and sleep. All of these are enemies. Sometimes one's conceptions are also \npolluted by goodness. (SB 7.15.43–44)\nIs there anyone who thinks that these enemies that we've listed have all been conquered? I'll read them \none more time.\nAttachment. One by one. Hostility. Greed. Lamentation, illusion, fear, madness, false prestige, insult, \nfault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, bewilderment, hunger, sleep. All of these are \nenemies.\nBy the strength of our own intelligence, to some degree, we may be able to deal with some of these \nenemies. But Prabhupada is going to make the point very clear in the purport that simply by knowledge\nitself one cannot cut away from these enemies.\nKrsna says clearly that the living entities in the material world are struggling very hard with material \nexistence. None of us can say, \"I'm not struggling with these things.\".\n\nOftentimes devotees ask me how to deal with the fact that they are struggling with Krsna \nconsciousness. I say to them, \"You're struggling?! It's good that you're struggling. As soon as you stop \nstruggling you're finished.\" If we're struggling it means that we want to overcome these bad influences. \nThose who don't want to overcome them, think it's natural to be lusty. It's natural to be envious. They \ndon't think they are in illusion because they think illusion is reality.\nWe should therefore struggle to find the spiritual strength to overcome these enemies. That much \nstruggling we have to do. If we don't struggle for that, we'll have to struggle with material nature, \nwhich is very hard on the living entity, and causes so much anxiety.\nPrabhupada says that this material world is kuntha. It is a place of anxiety. It cannot be avoided. \nEverything in this world is temporary and the eternal living entity is going to have to be in anxiety \nabout losing that which he is attached to. So he struggles with this illusory energy.\nA devotee therefore prays. \"Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare/ Hare Rama Hare Rama \nRama Rama Hare Hare.\" He's praying to Krsna. He's praying to Lord Balarama. \"Please give me the \nstrength so that I may be engaged in Krsna's service.\" He's praying to Srimati Radharani. Please engage\nme in Krsna's service. He's looking for strength. This is his struggle.\nSo just as this verse states that \"As long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and\nparaphernalia, which are not fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, \nnamely his spiritual master and the spiritual master's predecessors.\"\nSo let me read the purport. Please take note of the emphasis Srila Prabhupada is making about strength.\nIt's a little bit long. Try to listen carefully.\nIn Bhagavad-gita (4.9) the Lord says:\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\" This is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\nIn other words, this is what it means to accept help from the superiors is to go back home, back to \nGodhead. This is the destination that Krsna wants all living entities to achieve. And Lord Balarama and\nthose in the line of Lord Balarama are meant to give us the strength to go back to the spiritual world.\nThis is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\n... to go back home, back to Godhead.\nIt is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.20.17):\nnr-deham adyam sulabham sudurlabham\nplavam sukalpam guru-karnadharam\n\nmayanukulena nabhasvateritam\npuman bhavabdhim na taret sa atma-ha\nThis human form of body is a most valuable boat, and the spiritual master is the captain, guru-\nkarnadharam, to guide the boat in plying across the ocean of nescience. The instruction of Krsna \nis a favorable breeze. One must use all these facilities to cross over the ocean of nescience. Since \nthe spiritual master is the captain, one must serve the spiritual master very sincerely so that by his\nmercy one will be able to get the mercy of the Supreme Lord.\nA significant word here is acyuta-balah. The spiritual master is certainly very merciful to his \ndisciples, and consequently by satisfying him a devotee gets strength from the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore says, guru-krsna-prasade paya \nbhakti-lata-bija: [Cc. Madhya 19.151] one must first please the spiritual master, and then one \nautomatically pleases Krsna and gets the strength with which to cross the ocean of nescience.\nThis is the point I was making before. Simply knowledge, is insufficient. One can study the Vedas for \nmillions of births, as Lord Brahma says in Brahma Samhita, and still never be able to understand \nKrsna. So it's not simply by knowledge that one can cross the ocean of material existence.\nThe purport continues:\nIf one seriously desires to return home, back to Godhead, one must therefore become strong \nenough by pleasing the spiritual master, for thus one gets the weapon with which to conquer the \nenemy, and one also gets the grace of Krsna. Simply getting the weapon of jnana is insufficient. \nOne must sharpen the weapon by serving the spiritual master and adhering to his instructions. \nThen the candidate will get the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nPrabhupada then gives a nice analogy.\nIn general warfare one must take help from his chariot and horses in order to conquer his enemy, \nand after conquering his enemies he may give up the chariot and its paraphernalia. Similarly, as \nlong as one has a human body, one should fully use it to obtain the highest perfection of life, \nnamely going back home, back to Godhead.\nUsing the human form of life to its full potential.\nkamasya nendriya-pritir\nlabho jiveta yavata\njivasya tattva-jijnasa\nnartho yas ceha karmabhih\nLife's desires should never be directed toward sense gratification. One should desire only a healthy life,\nor self-preservation, since a human being is meant for inquiry about the Absolute Truth. Nothing else \nshould be the goal of one's works. (SB 1.2.10)\nThe perfection of knowledge is certainly to become transcendentally situated (brahma-bhuta [SB \n4.30.20]). As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):\n\nbrahma-bhutah prasannatma\nna socati na kanksati\nsamah sarvesu bhutesu\nmad-bhaktim labhate param\n\"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully \njoyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living \nentities. In that state he attains pure devotional service.\" Simply by cultivating knowledge as the \nimpersonalists do, one cannot get out of the clutches of maya. One must attain the platform of \nbhakti.\nbhaktya mam abhijanati\nyavan yas casmi tattvatah\ntato mam tattvato jnatva\nvisate tad-anantaram\n\"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one \nis in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of \nGod.\" (Bg. 18.55) Unless one has attained the stage of devotional service and the mercy of the \nspiritual master and Krsna, there is a possibility that one may fall down and again accept a \nmaterial body. Therefore Krsna stresses in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\"\nThe word tattvatah, meaning \"in reality,\" is very important. Tato mam tattvato jnatva. Unless one \nunderstands Krsna in truth by the mercy of the spiritual master, one is not free to give up his \nmaterial body.\nIn other words, one has to accept another material body.\n4\nAs it is said, aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah: [SB \n10.2.32] if one neglects to serve the lotus feet of Krsna, one cannot become free from the material\nclutches simply by knowledge. Even if one attains the stage of brahma-padam, merging in \nBrahman, without bhakti he is prone to fall down. One must be very careful in regard to the \ndanger of falling down again into material bondage. The only insurance is to come to the stage of \nbhakti, from which one is sure not to fall. Then one is free from the activities of the material \nworld. In summary, as stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, one must get in touch with a bona fide\nspiritual master coming in the parampara of Krsna consciousness, for by his mercy and \n\ninstructions one is able to get strength from Krsna. Thus one engages in devotional service and \nattains the ultimate goal of life, the lotus feet of Visnu.\nSignificant in this verse are the words jnanasim acyuta-balah. Jnanasim, the sword of knowledge, \nis given by Krsna, and when one serves the guru and Krsna in order to hold the sword of Krsna's \ninstructions, Balarama gives one strength. Balarama is Nityananda. Vrajendra-nandana yei, saci-\nsuta haila sei, balarama ha-ila nitai. This bala -- Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya \nMahaprabhu, and both of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take \nshelter of Their lotus feet. They come especially to deliver the fallen souls of this age, papi tapi \nyata chila, hari-name uddharila. Their weapon is sankirtana, hari-nama. Thus one should accept \nthe sword of knowledge from Krsna and be strong with the mercy of Balarama. We are therefore \nworshiping Krsna-Balarama in Vrndavana. In the Mundaka Upanisad (3.2.4) it is said:\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvams\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nOne cannot attain the goal of life without the mercy of Balarama. Sri Narottama dasa Thakura \ntherefore says, nitaiyera karuna habe, vraje radha-krsna pabe: when one receives the mercy of \nBalarama, Nityananda, one can attain the lotus feet of Radha and Krsna very easily.\nse sambandha nahi yara,   \nbrtha janma gela tara,\nvidya-kule hi karibe tara\nIf one has no connection with Nitai, Balarama, then even though one is a very learned scholar or \njnani or has taken birth in a very respectable family, these assets will not help him. We must \ntherefore conquer the enemies of Krsna consciousness with the strength received from Balarama. \n[end of purport]\nThese enemies are like whips. They are beating us again and again, keeping us in the bodily \nidentification. Imagine living with enemies. We are living with enemies right in our own bodies.\nKrsna described the enemy as lust. When Arjuna asked Krsna, \"What is it Krsna that compels a person \nto act even against his own will?\" Krsna replied that \"It's lust only Arjuna which is later transformed in \nanger, which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world.\" How to conquer this enemy on our own \nstrength?\nThose who try to do it on the strength of their own intelligence,\ntvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\n (SB 10.2.32)\n\n[...]their intelligence is impure. They fall down from their position of imagined superiority because \nthey have no regard for Your lotus feet.\nThey are destined to fall, because they haven't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus feet. They haven't taken \nshelter of Lord Balarama. They haven't taken shelter of bhakti, which manifests through the mercy of \nthe spiritual and the predecessor spiritual masters.\nThe spiritual master must represent the predecessor spiritual masters. Only by representing the \npredecessor spiritual master can one strive to achieve the Lord by the right means.\nThe verse nayam atma bala hinena labhyo clearly states that one has to achieve the Lord by the right \nmeans. One should not be wild or careless. By the right means Krsna reveals Himself and one enters \nthe spiritual world.\n5\nThis is the meaning of akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda guru tattva means that Lord Balarama manifests \nHimself as guru in an unlimited variety of forms. And it is the service of guru to give one the strength \nto cross over the ocean of material existence to enter into the spiritual world.\nSo this is how we worship Lord Balarama on His appearance day. We should know that He is adi-guru. \nHe is the original guru and and all other gurus represent Him. Without His mercy, without taking \nshelter of Him, we will never be able to give up this sense gratification and attachment to the material \nworld.\nAs described in the song Gauranga Bolite Ha'be, Narottama das Thakur is praying.\nara kabe nitai-candera karuna karibe\nsamsara-vasana mora kabe tuccha habe\n\"When will Lord Nityananda have mercy upon me so that I can realize the uselessness of material \npleasure?'\nHe is praying in that way. Who is Nityananda? He is Lord Balarama. Nityananda is the same as Lord \nBalarama. He has appeared to serve Lord Caitanya in the same way as Lord Balarama has appeared to \nserve Lord Krsna.\nAnd as Prabhupada says in today's purport, \"Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and \nboth of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take shelter of Their lotus \nfeet.\"\nWhat is their weapon?\nkrsna-varnam tvisakrsnam\nsangopangastra-parsadam\nSB 11.5.32\nThe verse describes how Lord Caitanya appears with His weapons. What is Lord Caitanya's weapon? \nHe's not coming to chop off heads. Not coming with a club to beat and destroy. He's coming with the \nweapon of harinama sankirtan. That is the weapon He has come with in this age of Kali.\n\nSrila Bhaktisiddhanti Sarasvati Thakur describes in one article of the Harmonist Magazine.\n\"Nityananda alone possesses the distinctive function of the guru. In Nityananda the function is \nembodied. Nityananda is the servant-God. He serves Sri Gaurasundara by the distinctive method of \nreverential servitude. He is identical with Sri Balarama of krsna-lila.[...]\n[...]\"But Nityananda does not directly instruct in the confidential service of Krsna. Srimati Radhika is \nthe guru of the inner circle of the servants of Krsna. Srimati Radhika, however, accepts the offer of \nservice of only those souls who are specially favored by Nityananda and are deemed by Him to be fit \nfor Her service.\nSo in all respects we are dependent upon the mercy of Nityananda Balarama to become qualifided to \ndance in the spiritual world and to be fully engaged in loving devotional service to the Lord.\nThis is the goal. Prabhupada clearly states this right from the outset of the verse. The goal is to go back \nhome, back to Godhead. The goal is not to be happy in this material world.\nThe devotee who understands this goal may become happy in this world. But as Rupa Goswami says, \nthere is three types of happiness. 1) Happiness derived from sense gratification, which is temporary. 2) \nHappiness which comes from liberation, which can also be temporary.\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\nOne will fall down from his position of imagined superiority if he hasn't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus \nfeet. And 3) The happiness which comes from bhakti, by realizing\njivera 'svarupa' haya -- krsnera 'nitya-dasa'\nI am Krsna's eternal servant, and my only business in life is to find shelter at His lotus feet. This is real \nhappiness.\nBy the mercy of guru, by the mercy of predecessor gurus, and by the mercy of Lord Balarama. This is \nwhat it means to take shelter. And this is why we observe Lord Balarama's appearance day... to pray for\nthis strength.\nHare Krsna","attachment_name":"balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf","attachment_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/sites/default/files/attachments/balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf"},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"ru":{"title":"26 августа, 2018 - Алматы, Казахстан - Лекция на Баларама Пурниме - Английский/ Русский","event":"Festival","topic":"Шримад Бхагаватам","translation":"Русский","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"","attachment_name":""},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"counters":{"audio_page_view":0,"audio_play_count":0,"downloads":"147","video_page_view":0,"en_transcription_view":0,"ru_transcription_view":0,"en_summary_view":0,"ru_summary_view":0}},{"uuid":"1f8bcffa-5bd8-42c3-b89d-081bfb0e3fe4","needs_translation":true,"created_date":"2018-08-26","published_date":"","author":"Niranjana Swami","part":"7","chapter":"15","verse":"45","download_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/download/33355","lecture_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/en/lecture/26495","duration":"01:37:59","downloads":"147","audio_link":"https://nrs-site.s3.amazonaws.com/lectures/2018/2018-08/niranjana_swami_-_sb_7.15.45_on_balarama-purnima_-c2a0almaty_26-aug-2018.mp3","soundCloud_link":"https://soundcloud.com/niranjana-swami/august-26-2018-almaty","youtube":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsg2S32qsdM?rel=gallery-all&wmode=opaque&autoplay=0"],"en":{"title":"August 26, 2018 - Almaty, Kazakhstan - Balarama Purnima Class - English/ Russian","event":"Festival","topic":"Srimad Bhagavatam","translation":"Russian","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"\n\nTranscription of a Lecture Given on Balarama Purnima, August 26, 2018, in Almaty, Kazakhstan\nThe following is a partially-edited lecture given in Almaty, Kazakhstan on Balarama Purnima, August \n26, 2018\nToday we are observing the appearance of Lord Balarama. I will first speak about, \"Who is Lord \nBalarama?.\" I will then speak on a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam in which Srila Prabhupada speaks \nabout the necessity of getting spiritual strength from Lord Balarama.\nLord Balarama is the first expansion of Lord Krsna called a svamsa expansion. There's very little \ndifference between Krsna and Balarama. They are both the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nSome of the differences are that is Krsna is blackish like the monsoon raincloud and Balarama is white.\nKrsna plays a flute and Balarama plays a buffalo horn. Sometimes Balarama carries a flute but most \noften He carries a buffalo horn in Vrndavana. Balarama sometimes carries a plow and club.\nBalarama manifested in Vrndavana as Krsna's elder brother. He first appeared in the womb of Devaki \nand later, by the arrangement of Yogamaya, He was transferred to the womb on Rohini. In Vrndavana, \nBalarama is known as Rohininandana, the son of Rohini.\nOutside of Vrndavana, Lord Balarama is manifest as Mula-sankarsana. Mula-sankarsana is the first \nexpansion coming from Lord Balarama. When Lord Balarama appeared in Vrndavana in the womb of \nRohini, this Mula-sankarsana became drawn to Him and appeared within Him. This is explained in \nGopal Campu. Just as Krsna never leaves Vrndavana, Balarama never leaves Vrndavana.\nFrom Lord Balarama manifests His plenary expansions beginning with Mula-sankarsana. As Mula-\nsankarsana, Balarama is manifest outside of Vrndavana in Mathura and Dwaraka.\nFrom Balarama also comes all living entities. Even the nitya-siddhas in the spiritual world, all of \nKrsna's devotees who are either in santa rasa, dasya rasa, sakyha rasa or vatsalya rasa are all coming \nfrom Lord Balarama. Vrndavana is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama. In fact, the whole \ndhama is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama.\nSo Balarama serves Krsna by providing all this for Krsna's pleasure in the spiritual world. Those in \nconjugal rasa, the gopis, are expansions coming from Srimati Radharani.\nIn this way, all of Krsna's eternal associates, Krsna parisada, are manifestations coming from either \nLord Balarama or Srimati Radharani in the spiritual world.\nMula-sankarsana further expands as Maha-sankarsana. As Maha-sankarsana He becomes the source of \nall of the living entities who are serving Krsna in Vaikuntha.\nWhen we say, \"From Lord Balarama comes\", it suggests that at one time, within time, the living entities\nmanifested from Lord Balarama. But we should know that being under the influence of material time, \nthese things are difficult to conceive in the material world.\n\nFor instance, Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita to Arjuna, \"Never was there a time when you did not exist, \nnever was there a time when all these kings assembled in the battlefield did not exist, never was there a \ntime when I did not exist, nor in the future will any of us cease to be.\" (BG 2.12)\nSo when we say that the living entities are all emanations or expansions coming from Lord Balarama, \nimmediately we have a tendency to think, \"Oh at some point in time, they manifested.\" However, they \nare all eternally manifest.\nJust as Krsna, as stated in Brahma Samhita, is beginningless. Lord Brahma says that Krsna is advaitam \nacyutam, anadim, ananta-rupam. He is nondual. His body is never subject to decay. He is the \nbeginning. He has no end. He is the source of everything. So beginningless means, never was there a \ntime when He did not exist.\nIn the same way, never was there a time when Lord Balarama did not exist. Never was there a time \nwhen all of Krsna's eternal associates did not exist, and the living entities, the jivas, never was there a \ntime when they did not exist. Krsna's energies are always existing simultaneously along with Krsna.\nJust like this material world goes through cycles. It's manifest, it stays for some time and then \nunmanifest. But this manifestation and unmanifestation is an eternal process without beginning or end.\nIf I give you a little time to think about it— just a little time. Never was there a time when Krsna, \nBalarama, the living entities did not exist. This cannot be understood by the limited mind. As long as \nwe are under the influence of time, it is very difficult to understand that which is existing in eternal \ntime.\nKrsna says \"the spiritual world is unmanifest, infallible, and it is the supreme destination. When one \ngoes there he never has to come back. \"When Krsna says that the spiritual world is unmanifest, does it \nmean that it doesn't exist? No. Never was there a time when it manifested. It's eternal. And Krsna says \nthat when one goes there, he never comes back. Tad dhama paramam mama. \"That is My supreme \nabode.\" (BG 8.21)\nSo, as we said, Balarama is the first expansion coming from Krsna. But when did Balarama expand \nfrom Krsna? And when did Maha-sankarsana, Mula-sankarsana expand from the original Balarama? \nAnd when from the Mula-sankarsana did Maha-sankarsana manifest in order to manifest the Vaikuntha \nplanets and all of Krsna's servants in the Vaikuntha planets who serve Him in His various forms? We \ncannot say when it happened. We only use those terms because we think in those terms. And we won't \nbe able to fully understand until we go beyond the influence of time ourselves. Those who are beyond \nthe influence of time, for them, time is ever-present. Krsna's pastimes and Balarama's pastimes in the \nspiritual world are eternally manifest.\nTime is also manifest in the spiritual world. But there it exists to assist Krsna and Balarama in Their \npastimes. There is no destructive feature of time in the spiritual world.\nEvery morning, Krsna, Balarama, and Their cowherd boyfriends after breakfast and milking the cows, \ngo out to the pastures. During the day when the sun is fully manifest in the sky, They along with the \ncowherd boys take shelter in the caves of Govardhana. As the sun continues to pass, later in the evening\nKrsna and Balarama with Their cowherd boyfriends and the cows, return to Gokula.\n\n2\nIn the spiritual world, time is manifest just to assist Krsna in His pastimes. But there is no destructive \nfeature of time as time destroys everything in the material world.\nKrsna tells Arjuna when He manifested the universal form, \"kalo 'smi loka-ksaya-krt pravrddho\", Time \nI am, the great destroyer of the worlds.\" (BG 11.32)\nSo when Krsna creates this material world, first He creates time. That's how creation takes place. \nOtherwise how could creation take place if there was no time? So when it's time for unmanifested \nmaterial elements to manifest as the external energy, time first appears.\nThen from Maha-sankarsana, as we said, in the spiritual world comes Karanadakasayi Visnu, who is \nalso a manifestation of Lord Balarama. And from Karandakasayi Visnu comes Garbodakasayi Visnu \nwho enters into each universe, which are generated from Karanadakasayi Visnu. And from \nGarbodakasayi Visnu who lies in the Garbodaka Ocean, comes the first created being in the universe, \nLord Brahma.\nThey are all expansions coming from Lord Balarama. Then there is Ksirodakasayi Visnu, who is also \nthe supersoul, manifested in the heart of all living beings. After the manifestation of Ksirodakasayi \nVisnu, comes Sesa who is a manifestation of the Lord who serves the Lord in various ways in this \nworld.\nAnanta-sesa, on each of His hoods, holds material universes. That's spiritual strength. Imagine holding \nunlimited universes on your hoods, and you standing on nothing? Try to conceive. It's inconceivable.\nSo Ananta-sea is holding all the universes on his different hoods but he rests on nothing. He is self-\nsufficient. And He is a manifestation of Lord Balarama.\nThere are two manifestations of Sesa. There's Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods, and \nthen there is the Ananta-sesa who is the bed of Lord Visnu. In the Laghu-bhagavatamrita Rupa \nGoswami explains that the Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods is an avesa avatara of \nLord Balarama. He is saktyavesa. He's an empowered jiva who holds the universe on his heads as \nAnanta-sesa.\nThe other manifestation of Sesa is a plenary expansion of Lord Balarama upon whom Lord Visnu lies.\nAnanta-sesa serves Lord Krsna, just as Lord Balarama is serving Lord Krsna in all of these different \nforms in the matter of creation and maintenance of this cosmic manifestation. Ananta-sesa is also \nmanifest as Krsna's pillow, Krsna's shoes, Krsna's bed, Krsna's sacred thread, Krsna's garments, etc.. In \nthis way, Ananta-sesa is rendering service to Krsna.\nSo Lord Balarama, in His different manifestations, is rendering service to Krsna in unlimited ways. \nEven though Lord Balarama is Krsna Himself, He is always absorbed in the mood of, \"I am Krsna's \nservant.\"\nLord Balarama's service mood towards Krsna is described as sankula, or mixed. He is Krsna's friend. \nKrsna goes out with his cowherd boyfriends. Lord Balarama is going with Him into the pasturing \n\ngrounds. He's Krsna's servant as we already described in various ways how Lord Balarama renders \nservice to Krsna. And He also has a mood of vatsalya, because He is Krsna's older brother.\nIn Vedic culture, ancient culture, the older brother is always worshipped and respected as one's \nsuperior. So Balarama also has this vatsalya mood of protecting Krsna.\nWhen Balarama and Krsna entered into the forest of Dhenukasura, Krsna spoke about Lord Balarama \nas follows:\n\"O greatest of Lords, just see how these trees are bowing their heads at Your lotus feet, which are \nworshipable by the immortal demigods. The trees are offering You their fruits and flowers to eradicate \nthe dark ignorance that has caused their birth as trees.\" (SB 10.15.5)\nSo Krsna is considering Balarama His superior. In the forest of Dhenukasura, Balarama is lying down \nwith His head on the lap of the cowherd boys and Krsna is taking Balarama's lotus feet and is \nmassaging them. So Balarama also serves Krsna in this vatsalya mood and is treated as a superior by \nKrsna. Balarama also serves Krsna in madhurya-rasa. But to do that, He is manifested as Ananga-\nmanjari, the sister of Radharani.\nBalarama is also considered Adi-guru. Adi-guru means the original guru. Just as Krsna treats Balarama \nas a superior, He also treats Him as guru. Balarama is akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda means unlimited. \nIn other words, Balarama is the guru that manifests in unlimited forms to serve as guru. And all gurus \nare understood to be representatives of Lord Balarama, who is the source of spiritual strength.\nPrabhupada explains in Krsna book. \"In the Upanisad it is stated, nayam atma bala-hinena labhyah. The\npurport is that one cannot attain the supreme platform of self-realization without being sufficiently \nfavored by Balarama. Bala does not mean physical strength. No one can attain spiritual perfection by \nphysical strength. One must have the spiritual strength which is infused by Balarama, or Sankarsana. \nAnanta, or Sesa, is the power which sustains all the planets in their different positions. Materially this \nsustaining power is known as the law of gravitation, but actually it is a display of the potency of \nSankarsana. Balarama, or Sankarsana, is spiritual power, or the original spiritual master. Therefore \nLord Nityananda Prabhu, who is also the incarnation of Balarama, is the original spiritual master. And \nthe spiritual master is the representative of Balarama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who \nsupplies spiritual strength. In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is confirmed that the spiritual master is the \nmanifestation of the mercy of Krsna.\" (Krsna Book Ch. 2)\nSo Prabhupada refers to the verse from the Mundaka Upanisad.\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvan\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nThis verse means, \"The Supreme Lord cannot be attained by one who has no spiritual strength, one \nwho is careless or wild, or whose austerites are inappropriate. The Lord appears before a person who \nstrives by the right means to attain Him. Such a person enters the spiritual world.\"\n\nOne requires spiritual strength in order to understand Krsna and to enter the spiritual world. \nPrabhupada says that we are not talking about physical strength. Spiritual strength is the strength to \novercome the influence of the modes of material nature, to cross the ocean of material existence, and to\nbecome qualified to enter into that supreme abode which is unmanifest and infallible.\nWho is the source of spiritual strength? It is Balarama who is akhanda guru tattva. He manifests \nHimself in various forms in order to give strength to the living entities in the material world so they can\nfind the determination, courage, and satisfaction to overcome the stringent laws of material nature and \nto achieve entrance into that eternal abode.\nAs the Mundaka Upanisad says, \"Krsna manifests Himself to that person who strives to achieve Him \nby the right means.\" What is the right means?\nThat is the verse we wanted to read today from Srimad Bhagavatam. This verse speaks about the right \nmeans to cross the ocean of material existence, by getting strength from the spiritual master and \npredecessor spiritual masters.\nHow can we overcome the illusory energy by our own strength? A devotee never thinks, \"I am \nspiritually strong by my own endeavors.\" He knows that whatever spiritual strength he has, has been \ngiven to him because he is taking shelter of spiritual strength.\nJust as one takes shelter of Krsna consciousness,\nkrsna -- surya-sama, maya haya andhakara\nyahan krsna, tahan nahi mayara adhikara\n\"Krsna is compared to sunshine, and maya is compared to darkness. Wherever there is sunshine, there \ncannot be darkness. As soon as one takes to Krsna consciousness, the darkness of illusion (the influence\nof the external energy) will immediately vanish. (Madhya 22.31)\nWherever there is Krsna, there cannot be maya. Wherever there is Krsna consciousness, there cannot be\nthe influence of illusion. But we cannot manifest Krsna before us by our own strength.\nSrimad Bhagavatam states:\nathapi te deva padambuja-dvaya-\nprasada-lesanugrhita eva hi\njanati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno\nna canya eko 'pi ciram vicinvan\nMy Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the \ngreatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years. (SB \n10.14.29)\nUnless one gets that drop of mercy he cannot understand.\n3\nKrsna tells Arjuna,\n\nMy dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before \nyou, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My \nunderstanding. (Bg 11.54)\nTherefore the knowledge and strength to cross over the material existence is coming from Krsna and \nBalarama. Balarama is Adi-guru, the original guru, He is the original source of all spiritual strength. If \none wishes to get spiritual strength, he must take shelter of guru and as this verse we are going to read \ntoday says, our predecessor gurus.\nSo this is the verse and purport that I am going to read in this connection. It's the 7th Canto of Srimad \nBhagavatam, 15th chapter, 45th verse.\nyavan nr-kaya-ratham atma-vasopakalpam\ndhatte garistha-caranarcanaya nisatam\njnanasim acyuta-balo dadhad asta-satruh\nsvananda-tusta upasanta idam vijahyat\nTRANSLATION\nAs long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and paraphernalia, which are \nnot fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, namely his spiritual \nmaster and the spiritual master's predecessors. By their mercy, one can sharpen the sword of \nknowledge, and with the power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's mercy one must then \nconquer the enemies mentioned above. In this way, the devotee should be able to merge into his \nown transcendental bliss, and then he may give up his body and resume his spiritual identity.\nThis verse refers to the enemies mentioned in the previous verse. So in order to more fully understand \nwhat this verse is talking about one should know what these enemies are. And this is the previous verse.\nIn the conditioned stage, one's conceptions of life are sometimes polluted by passion and \nignorance, which are exhibited by attachment, hostility, greed, lamentation, illusion, fear, \nmadness, false prestige, insults, fault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, \nbewilderment, hunger and sleep. All of these are enemies. Sometimes one's conceptions are also \npolluted by goodness. (SB 7.15.43–44)\nIs there anyone who thinks that these enemies that we've listed have all been conquered? I'll read them \none more time.\nAttachment. One by one. Hostility. Greed. Lamentation, illusion, fear, madness, false prestige, insult, \nfault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, bewilderment, hunger, sleep. All of these are \nenemies.\nBy the strength of our own intelligence, to some degree, we may be able to deal with some of these \nenemies. But Prabhupada is going to make the point very clear in the purport that simply by knowledge\nitself one cannot cut away from these enemies.\nKrsna says clearly that the living entities in the material world are struggling very hard with material \nexistence. None of us can say, \"I'm not struggling with these things.\".\n\nOftentimes devotees ask me how to deal with the fact that they are struggling with Krsna \nconsciousness. I say to them, \"You're struggling?! It's good that you're struggling. As soon as you stop \nstruggling you're finished.\" If we're struggling it means that we want to overcome these bad influences. \nThose who don't want to overcome them, think it's natural to be lusty. It's natural to be envious. They \ndon't think they are in illusion because they think illusion is reality.\nWe should therefore struggle to find the spiritual strength to overcome these enemies. That much \nstruggling we have to do. If we don't struggle for that, we'll have to struggle with material nature, \nwhich is very hard on the living entity, and causes so much anxiety.\nPrabhupada says that this material world is kuntha. It is a place of anxiety. It cannot be avoided. \nEverything in this world is temporary and the eternal living entity is going to have to be in anxiety \nabout losing that which he is attached to. So he struggles with this illusory energy.\nA devotee therefore prays. \"Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare/ Hare Rama Hare Rama \nRama Rama Hare Hare.\" He's praying to Krsna. He's praying to Lord Balarama. \"Please give me the \nstrength so that I may be engaged in Krsna's service.\" He's praying to Srimati Radharani. Please engage\nme in Krsna's service. He's looking for strength. This is his struggle.\nSo just as this verse states that \"As long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and\nparaphernalia, which are not fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, \nnamely his spiritual master and the spiritual master's predecessors.\"\nSo let me read the purport. Please take note of the emphasis Srila Prabhupada is making about strength.\nIt's a little bit long. Try to listen carefully.\nIn Bhagavad-gita (4.9) the Lord says:\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\" This is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\nIn other words, this is what it means to accept help from the superiors is to go back home, back to \nGodhead. This is the destination that Krsna wants all living entities to achieve. And Lord Balarama and\nthose in the line of Lord Balarama are meant to give us the strength to go back to the spiritual world.\nThis is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\n... to go back home, back to Godhead.\nIt is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.20.17):\nnr-deham adyam sulabham sudurlabham\nplavam sukalpam guru-karnadharam\n\nmayanukulena nabhasvateritam\npuman bhavabdhim na taret sa atma-ha\nThis human form of body is a most valuable boat, and the spiritual master is the captain, guru-\nkarnadharam, to guide the boat in plying across the ocean of nescience. The instruction of Krsna \nis a favorable breeze. One must use all these facilities to cross over the ocean of nescience. Since \nthe spiritual master is the captain, one must serve the spiritual master very sincerely so that by his\nmercy one will be able to get the mercy of the Supreme Lord.\nA significant word here is acyuta-balah. The spiritual master is certainly very merciful to his \ndisciples, and consequently by satisfying him a devotee gets strength from the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore says, guru-krsna-prasade paya \nbhakti-lata-bija: [Cc. Madhya 19.151] one must first please the spiritual master, and then one \nautomatically pleases Krsna and gets the strength with which to cross the ocean of nescience.\nThis is the point I was making before. Simply knowledge, is insufficient. One can study the Vedas for \nmillions of births, as Lord Brahma says in Brahma Samhita, and still never be able to understand \nKrsna. So it's not simply by knowledge that one can cross the ocean of material existence.\nThe purport continues:\nIf one seriously desires to return home, back to Godhead, one must therefore become strong \nenough by pleasing the spiritual master, for thus one gets the weapon with which to conquer the \nenemy, and one also gets the grace of Krsna. Simply getting the weapon of jnana is insufficient. \nOne must sharpen the weapon by serving the spiritual master and adhering to his instructions. \nThen the candidate will get the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nPrabhupada then gives a nice analogy.\nIn general warfare one must take help from his chariot and horses in order to conquer his enemy, \nand after conquering his enemies he may give up the chariot and its paraphernalia. Similarly, as \nlong as one has a human body, one should fully use it to obtain the highest perfection of life, \nnamely going back home, back to Godhead.\nUsing the human form of life to its full potential.\nkamasya nendriya-pritir\nlabho jiveta yavata\njivasya tattva-jijnasa\nnartho yas ceha karmabhih\nLife's desires should never be directed toward sense gratification. One should desire only a healthy life,\nor self-preservation, since a human being is meant for inquiry about the Absolute Truth. Nothing else \nshould be the goal of one's works. (SB 1.2.10)\nThe perfection of knowledge is certainly to become transcendentally situated (brahma-bhuta [SB \n4.30.20]). As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):\n\nbrahma-bhutah prasannatma\nna socati na kanksati\nsamah sarvesu bhutesu\nmad-bhaktim labhate param\n\"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully \njoyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living \nentities. In that state he attains pure devotional service.\" Simply by cultivating knowledge as the \nimpersonalists do, one cannot get out of the clutches of maya. One must attain the platform of \nbhakti.\nbhaktya mam abhijanati\nyavan yas casmi tattvatah\ntato mam tattvato jnatva\nvisate tad-anantaram\n\"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one \nis in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of \nGod.\" (Bg. 18.55) Unless one has attained the stage of devotional service and the mercy of the \nspiritual master and Krsna, there is a possibility that one may fall down and again accept a \nmaterial body. Therefore Krsna stresses in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\"\nThe word tattvatah, meaning \"in reality,\" is very important. Tato mam tattvato jnatva. Unless one \nunderstands Krsna in truth by the mercy of the spiritual master, one is not free to give up his \nmaterial body.\nIn other words, one has to accept another material body.\n4\nAs it is said, aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah: [SB \n10.2.32] if one neglects to serve the lotus feet of Krsna, one cannot become free from the material\nclutches simply by knowledge. Even if one attains the stage of brahma-padam, merging in \nBrahman, without bhakti he is prone to fall down. One must be very careful in regard to the \ndanger of falling down again into material bondage. The only insurance is to come to the stage of \nbhakti, from which one is sure not to fall. Then one is free from the activities of the material \nworld. In summary, as stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, one must get in touch with a bona fide\nspiritual master coming in the parampara of Krsna consciousness, for by his mercy and \n\ninstructions one is able to get strength from Krsna. Thus one engages in devotional service and \nattains the ultimate goal of life, the lotus feet of Visnu.\nSignificant in this verse are the words jnanasim acyuta-balah. Jnanasim, the sword of knowledge, \nis given by Krsna, and when one serves the guru and Krsna in order to hold the sword of Krsna's \ninstructions, Balarama gives one strength. Balarama is Nityananda. Vrajendra-nandana yei, saci-\nsuta haila sei, balarama ha-ila nitai. This bala -- Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya \nMahaprabhu, and both of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take \nshelter of Their lotus feet. They come especially to deliver the fallen souls of this age, papi tapi \nyata chila, hari-name uddharila. Their weapon is sankirtana, hari-nama. Thus one should accept \nthe sword of knowledge from Krsna and be strong with the mercy of Balarama. We are therefore \nworshiping Krsna-Balarama in Vrndavana. In the Mundaka Upanisad (3.2.4) it is said:\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvams\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nOne cannot attain the goal of life without the mercy of Balarama. Sri Narottama dasa Thakura \ntherefore says, nitaiyera karuna habe, vraje radha-krsna pabe: when one receives the mercy of \nBalarama, Nityananda, one can attain the lotus feet of Radha and Krsna very easily.\nse sambandha nahi yara,   \nbrtha janma gela tara,\nvidya-kule hi karibe tara\nIf one has no connection with Nitai, Balarama, then even though one is a very learned scholar or \njnani or has taken birth in a very respectable family, these assets will not help him. We must \ntherefore conquer the enemies of Krsna consciousness with the strength received from Balarama. \n[end of purport]\nThese enemies are like whips. They are beating us again and again, keeping us in the bodily \nidentification. Imagine living with enemies. We are living with enemies right in our own bodies.\nKrsna described the enemy as lust. When Arjuna asked Krsna, \"What is it Krsna that compels a person \nto act even against his own will?\" Krsna replied that \"It's lust only Arjuna which is later transformed in \nanger, which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world.\" How to conquer this enemy on our own \nstrength?\nThose who try to do it on the strength of their own intelligence,\ntvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\n (SB 10.2.32)\n\n[...]their intelligence is impure. They fall down from their position of imagined superiority because \nthey have no regard for Your lotus feet.\nThey are destined to fall, because they haven't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus feet. They haven't taken \nshelter of Lord Balarama. They haven't taken shelter of bhakti, which manifests through the mercy of \nthe spiritual and the predecessor spiritual masters.\nThe spiritual master must represent the predecessor spiritual masters. Only by representing the \npredecessor spiritual master can one strive to achieve the Lord by the right means.\nThe verse nayam atma bala hinena labhyo clearly states that one has to achieve the Lord by the right \nmeans. One should not be wild or careless. By the right means Krsna reveals Himself and one enters \nthe spiritual world.\n5\nThis is the meaning of akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda guru tattva means that Lord Balarama manifests \nHimself as guru in an unlimited variety of forms. And it is the service of guru to give one the strength \nto cross over the ocean of material existence to enter into the spiritual world.\nSo this is how we worship Lord Balarama on His appearance day. We should know that He is adi-guru. \nHe is the original guru and and all other gurus represent Him. Without His mercy, without taking \nshelter of Him, we will never be able to give up this sense gratification and attachment to the material \nworld.\nAs described in the song Gauranga Bolite Ha'be, Narottama das Thakur is praying.\nara kabe nitai-candera karuna karibe\nsamsara-vasana mora kabe tuccha habe\n\"When will Lord Nityananda have mercy upon me so that I can realize the uselessness of material \npleasure?'\nHe is praying in that way. Who is Nityananda? He is Lord Balarama. Nityananda is the same as Lord \nBalarama. He has appeared to serve Lord Caitanya in the same way as Lord Balarama has appeared to \nserve Lord Krsna.\nAnd as Prabhupada says in today's purport, \"Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and \nboth of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take shelter of Their lotus \nfeet.\"\nWhat is their weapon?\nkrsna-varnam tvisakrsnam\nsangopangastra-parsadam\nSB 11.5.32\nThe verse describes how Lord Caitanya appears with His weapons. What is Lord Caitanya's weapon? \nHe's not coming to chop off heads. Not coming with a club to beat and destroy. He's coming with the \nweapon of harinama sankirtan. That is the weapon He has come with in this age of Kali.\n\nSrila Bhaktisiddhanti Sarasvati Thakur describes in one article of the Harmonist Magazine.\n\"Nityananda alone possesses the distinctive function of the guru. In Nityananda the function is \nembodied. Nityananda is the servant-God. He serves Sri Gaurasundara by the distinctive method of \nreverential servitude. He is identical with Sri Balarama of krsna-lila.[...]\n[...]\"But Nityananda does not directly instruct in the confidential service of Krsna. Srimati Radhika is \nthe guru of the inner circle of the servants of Krsna. Srimati Radhika, however, accepts the offer of \nservice of only those souls who are specially favored by Nityananda and are deemed by Him to be fit \nfor Her service.\nSo in all respects we are dependent upon the mercy of Nityananda Balarama to become qualifided to \ndance in the spiritual world and to be fully engaged in loving devotional service to the Lord.\nThis is the goal. Prabhupada clearly states this right from the outset of the verse. The goal is to go back \nhome, back to Godhead. The goal is not to be happy in this material world.\nThe devotee who understands this goal may become happy in this world. But as Rupa Goswami says, \nthere is three types of happiness. 1) Happiness derived from sense gratification, which is temporary. 2) \nHappiness which comes from liberation, which can also be temporary.\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\nOne will fall down from his position of imagined superiority if he hasn't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus \nfeet. And 3) The happiness which comes from bhakti, by realizing\njivera 'svarupa' haya -- krsnera 'nitya-dasa'\nI am Krsna's eternal servant, and my only business in life is to find shelter at His lotus feet. This is real \nhappiness.\nBy the mercy of guru, by the mercy of predecessor gurus, and by the mercy of Lord Balarama. This is \nwhat it means to take shelter. And this is why we observe Lord Balarama's appearance day... to pray for\nthis strength.\nHare Krsna","attachment_name":"balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf","attachment_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/sites/default/files/attachments/balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf"},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"ru":{"title":"26 августа, 2018 - Алматы, Казахстан - Лекция на Баларама Пурниме - Английский/ Русский","event":"Festival","topic":"Шримад Бхагаватам","translation":"Русский","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"","attachment_name":""},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"counters":{"audio_page_view":0,"audio_play_count":0,"downloads":"147","video_page_view":0,"en_transcription_view":0,"ru_transcription_view":0,"en_summary_view":0,"ru_summary_view":0}},{"uuid":"1f8bcffa-5bd8-42c3-b89d-081bfb0e3fe4","needs_translation":true,"created_date":"2018-08-26","published_date":"","author":"Niranjana Swami","part":"7","chapter":"15","verse":"45","download_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/download/33355","lecture_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/en/lecture/26495","duration":"01:37:59","downloads":"147","audio_link":"https://nrs-site.s3.amazonaws.com/lectures/2018/2018-08/niranjana_swami_-_sb_7.15.45_on_balarama-purnima_-c2a0almaty_26-aug-2018.mp3","soundCloud_link":"https://soundcloud.com/niranjana-swami/august-26-2018-almaty","youtube":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsg2S32qsdM?rel=gallery-all&wmode=opaque&autoplay=0"],"en":{"title":"August 26, 2018 - Almaty, Kazakhstan - Balarama Purnima Class - English/ Russian","event":"Festival","topic":"Srimad Bhagavatam","translation":"Russian","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"\n\nTranscription of a Lecture Given on Balarama Purnima, August 26, 2018, in Almaty, Kazakhstan\nThe following is a partially-edited lecture given in Almaty, Kazakhstan on Balarama Purnima, August \n26, 2018\nToday we are observing the appearance of Lord Balarama. I will first speak about, \"Who is Lord \nBalarama?.\" I will then speak on a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam in which Srila Prabhupada speaks \nabout the necessity of getting spiritual strength from Lord Balarama.\nLord Balarama is the first expansion of Lord Krsna called a svamsa expansion. There's very little \ndifference between Krsna and Balarama. They are both the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nSome of the differences are that is Krsna is blackish like the monsoon raincloud and Balarama is white.\nKrsna plays a flute and Balarama plays a buffalo horn. Sometimes Balarama carries a flute but most \noften He carries a buffalo horn in Vrndavana. Balarama sometimes carries a plow and club.\nBalarama manifested in Vrndavana as Krsna's elder brother. He first appeared in the womb of Devaki \nand later, by the arrangement of Yogamaya, He was transferred to the womb on Rohini. In Vrndavana, \nBalarama is known as Rohininandana, the son of Rohini.\nOutside of Vrndavana, Lord Balarama is manifest as Mula-sankarsana. Mula-sankarsana is the first \nexpansion coming from Lord Balarama. When Lord Balarama appeared in Vrndavana in the womb of \nRohini, this Mula-sankarsana became drawn to Him and appeared within Him. This is explained in \nGopal Campu. Just as Krsna never leaves Vrndavana, Balarama never leaves Vrndavana.\nFrom Lord Balarama manifests His plenary expansions beginning with Mula-sankarsana. As Mula-\nsankarsana, Balarama is manifest outside of Vrndavana in Mathura and Dwaraka.\nFrom Balarama also comes all living entities. Even the nitya-siddhas in the spiritual world, all of \nKrsna's devotees who are either in santa rasa, dasya rasa, sakyha rasa or vatsalya rasa are all coming \nfrom Lord Balarama. Vrndavana is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama. In fact, the whole \ndhama is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama.\nSo Balarama serves Krsna by providing all this for Krsna's pleasure in the spiritual world. Those in \nconjugal rasa, the gopis, are expansions coming from Srimati Radharani.\nIn this way, all of Krsna's eternal associates, Krsna parisada, are manifestations coming from either \nLord Balarama or Srimati Radharani in the spiritual world.\nMula-sankarsana further expands as Maha-sankarsana. As Maha-sankarsana He becomes the source of \nall of the living entities who are serving Krsna in Vaikuntha.\nWhen we say, \"From Lord Balarama comes\", it suggests that at one time, within time, the living entities\nmanifested from Lord Balarama. But we should know that being under the influence of material time, \nthese things are difficult to conceive in the material world.\n\nFor instance, Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita to Arjuna, \"Never was there a time when you did not exist, \nnever was there a time when all these kings assembled in the battlefield did not exist, never was there a \ntime when I did not exist, nor in the future will any of us cease to be.\" (BG 2.12)\nSo when we say that the living entities are all emanations or expansions coming from Lord Balarama, \nimmediately we have a tendency to think, \"Oh at some point in time, they manifested.\" However, they \nare all eternally manifest.\nJust as Krsna, as stated in Brahma Samhita, is beginningless. Lord Brahma says that Krsna is advaitam \nacyutam, anadim, ananta-rupam. He is nondual. His body is never subject to decay. He is the \nbeginning. He has no end. He is the source of everything. So beginningless means, never was there a \ntime when He did not exist.\nIn the same way, never was there a time when Lord Balarama did not exist. Never was there a time \nwhen all of Krsna's eternal associates did not exist, and the living entities, the jivas, never was there a \ntime when they did not exist. Krsna's energies are always existing simultaneously along with Krsna.\nJust like this material world goes through cycles. It's manifest, it stays for some time and then \nunmanifest. But this manifestation and unmanifestation is an eternal process without beginning or end.\nIf I give you a little time to think about it— just a little time. Never was there a time when Krsna, \nBalarama, the living entities did not exist. This cannot be understood by the limited mind. As long as \nwe are under the influence of time, it is very difficult to understand that which is existing in eternal \ntime.\nKrsna says \"the spiritual world is unmanifest, infallible, and it is the supreme destination. When one \ngoes there he never has to come back. \"When Krsna says that the spiritual world is unmanifest, does it \nmean that it doesn't exist? No. Never was there a time when it manifested. It's eternal. And Krsna says \nthat when one goes there, he never comes back. Tad dhama paramam mama. \"That is My supreme \nabode.\" (BG 8.21)\nSo, as we said, Balarama is the first expansion coming from Krsna. But when did Balarama expand \nfrom Krsna? And when did Maha-sankarsana, Mula-sankarsana expand from the original Balarama? \nAnd when from the Mula-sankarsana did Maha-sankarsana manifest in order to manifest the Vaikuntha \nplanets and all of Krsna's servants in the Vaikuntha planets who serve Him in His various forms? We \ncannot say when it happened. We only use those terms because we think in those terms. And we won't \nbe able to fully understand until we go beyond the influence of time ourselves. Those who are beyond \nthe influence of time, for them, time is ever-present. Krsna's pastimes and Balarama's pastimes in the \nspiritual world are eternally manifest.\nTime is also manifest in the spiritual world. But there it exists to assist Krsna and Balarama in Their \npastimes. There is no destructive feature of time in the spiritual world.\nEvery morning, Krsna, Balarama, and Their cowherd boyfriends after breakfast and milking the cows, \ngo out to the pastures. During the day when the sun is fully manifest in the sky, They along with the \ncowherd boys take shelter in the caves of Govardhana. As the sun continues to pass, later in the evening\nKrsna and Balarama with Their cowherd boyfriends and the cows, return to Gokula.\n\n2\nIn the spiritual world, time is manifest just to assist Krsna in His pastimes. But there is no destructive \nfeature of time as time destroys everything in the material world.\nKrsna tells Arjuna when He manifested the universal form, \"kalo 'smi loka-ksaya-krt pravrddho\", Time \nI am, the great destroyer of the worlds.\" (BG 11.32)\nSo when Krsna creates this material world, first He creates time. That's how creation takes place. \nOtherwise how could creation take place if there was no time? So when it's time for unmanifested \nmaterial elements to manifest as the external energy, time first appears.\nThen from Maha-sankarsana, as we said, in the spiritual world comes Karanadakasayi Visnu, who is \nalso a manifestation of Lord Balarama. And from Karandakasayi Visnu comes Garbodakasayi Visnu \nwho enters into each universe, which are generated from Karanadakasayi Visnu. And from \nGarbodakasayi Visnu who lies in the Garbodaka Ocean, comes the first created being in the universe, \nLord Brahma.\nThey are all expansions coming from Lord Balarama. Then there is Ksirodakasayi Visnu, who is also \nthe supersoul, manifested in the heart of all living beings. After the manifestation of Ksirodakasayi \nVisnu, comes Sesa who is a manifestation of the Lord who serves the Lord in various ways in this \nworld.\nAnanta-sesa, on each of His hoods, holds material universes. That's spiritual strength. Imagine holding \nunlimited universes on your hoods, and you standing on nothing? Try to conceive. It's inconceivable.\nSo Ananta-sea is holding all the universes on his different hoods but he rests on nothing. He is self-\nsufficient. And He is a manifestation of Lord Balarama.\nThere are two manifestations of Sesa. There's Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods, and \nthen there is the Ananta-sesa who is the bed of Lord Visnu. In the Laghu-bhagavatamrita Rupa \nGoswami explains that the Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods is an avesa avatara of \nLord Balarama. He is saktyavesa. He's an empowered jiva who holds the universe on his heads as \nAnanta-sesa.\nThe other manifestation of Sesa is a plenary expansion of Lord Balarama upon whom Lord Visnu lies.\nAnanta-sesa serves Lord Krsna, just as Lord Balarama is serving Lord Krsna in all of these different \nforms in the matter of creation and maintenance of this cosmic manifestation. Ananta-sesa is also \nmanifest as Krsna's pillow, Krsna's shoes, Krsna's bed, Krsna's sacred thread, Krsna's garments, etc.. In \nthis way, Ananta-sesa is rendering service to Krsna.\nSo Lord Balarama, in His different manifestations, is rendering service to Krsna in unlimited ways. \nEven though Lord Balarama is Krsna Himself, He is always absorbed in the mood of, \"I am Krsna's \nservant.\"\nLord Balarama's service mood towards Krsna is described as sankula, or mixed. He is Krsna's friend. \nKrsna goes out with his cowherd boyfriends. Lord Balarama is going with Him into the pasturing \n\ngrounds. He's Krsna's servant as we already described in various ways how Lord Balarama renders \nservice to Krsna. And He also has a mood of vatsalya, because He is Krsna's older brother.\nIn Vedic culture, ancient culture, the older brother is always worshipped and respected as one's \nsuperior. So Balarama also has this vatsalya mood of protecting Krsna.\nWhen Balarama and Krsna entered into the forest of Dhenukasura, Krsna spoke about Lord Balarama \nas follows:\n\"O greatest of Lords, just see how these trees are bowing their heads at Your lotus feet, which are \nworshipable by the immortal demigods. The trees are offering You their fruits and flowers to eradicate \nthe dark ignorance that has caused their birth as trees.\" (SB 10.15.5)\nSo Krsna is considering Balarama His superior. In the forest of Dhenukasura, Balarama is lying down \nwith His head on the lap of the cowherd boys and Krsna is taking Balarama's lotus feet and is \nmassaging them. So Balarama also serves Krsna in this vatsalya mood and is treated as a superior by \nKrsna. Balarama also serves Krsna in madhurya-rasa. But to do that, He is manifested as Ananga-\nmanjari, the sister of Radharani.\nBalarama is also considered Adi-guru. Adi-guru means the original guru. Just as Krsna treats Balarama \nas a superior, He also treats Him as guru. Balarama is akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda means unlimited. \nIn other words, Balarama is the guru that manifests in unlimited forms to serve as guru. And all gurus \nare understood to be representatives of Lord Balarama, who is the source of spiritual strength.\nPrabhupada explains in Krsna book. \"In the Upanisad it is stated, nayam atma bala-hinena labhyah. The\npurport is that one cannot attain the supreme platform of self-realization without being sufficiently \nfavored by Balarama. Bala does not mean physical strength. No one can attain spiritual perfection by \nphysical strength. One must have the spiritual strength which is infused by Balarama, or Sankarsana. \nAnanta, or Sesa, is the power which sustains all the planets in their different positions. Materially this \nsustaining power is known as the law of gravitation, but actually it is a display of the potency of \nSankarsana. Balarama, or Sankarsana, is spiritual power, or the original spiritual master. Therefore \nLord Nityananda Prabhu, who is also the incarnation of Balarama, is the original spiritual master. And \nthe spiritual master is the representative of Balarama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who \nsupplies spiritual strength. In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is confirmed that the spiritual master is the \nmanifestation of the mercy of Krsna.\" (Krsna Book Ch. 2)\nSo Prabhupada refers to the verse from the Mundaka Upanisad.\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvan\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nThis verse means, \"The Supreme Lord cannot be attained by one who has no spiritual strength, one \nwho is careless or wild, or whose austerites are inappropriate. The Lord appears before a person who \nstrives by the right means to attain Him. Such a person enters the spiritual world.\"\n\nOne requires spiritual strength in order to understand Krsna and to enter the spiritual world. \nPrabhupada says that we are not talking about physical strength. Spiritual strength is the strength to \novercome the influence of the modes of material nature, to cross the ocean of material existence, and to\nbecome qualified to enter into that supreme abode which is unmanifest and infallible.\nWho is the source of spiritual strength? It is Balarama who is akhanda guru tattva. He manifests \nHimself in various forms in order to give strength to the living entities in the material world so they can\nfind the determination, courage, and satisfaction to overcome the stringent laws of material nature and \nto achieve entrance into that eternal abode.\nAs the Mundaka Upanisad says, \"Krsna manifests Himself to that person who strives to achieve Him \nby the right means.\" What is the right means?\nThat is the verse we wanted to read today from Srimad Bhagavatam. This verse speaks about the right \nmeans to cross the ocean of material existence, by getting strength from the spiritual master and \npredecessor spiritual masters.\nHow can we overcome the illusory energy by our own strength? A devotee never thinks, \"I am \nspiritually strong by my own endeavors.\" He knows that whatever spiritual strength he has, has been \ngiven to him because he is taking shelter of spiritual strength.\nJust as one takes shelter of Krsna consciousness,\nkrsna -- surya-sama, maya haya andhakara\nyahan krsna, tahan nahi mayara adhikara\n\"Krsna is compared to sunshine, and maya is compared to darkness. Wherever there is sunshine, there \ncannot be darkness. As soon as one takes to Krsna consciousness, the darkness of illusion (the influence\nof the external energy) will immediately vanish. (Madhya 22.31)\nWherever there is Krsna, there cannot be maya. Wherever there is Krsna consciousness, there cannot be\nthe influence of illusion. But we cannot manifest Krsna before us by our own strength.\nSrimad Bhagavatam states:\nathapi te deva padambuja-dvaya-\nprasada-lesanugrhita eva hi\njanati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno\nna canya eko 'pi ciram vicinvan\nMy Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the \ngreatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years. (SB \n10.14.29)\nUnless one gets that drop of mercy he cannot understand.\n3\nKrsna tells Arjuna,\n\nMy dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before \nyou, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My \nunderstanding. (Bg 11.54)\nTherefore the knowledge and strength to cross over the material existence is coming from Krsna and \nBalarama. Balarama is Adi-guru, the original guru, He is the original source of all spiritual strength. If \none wishes to get spiritual strength, he must take shelter of guru and as this verse we are going to read \ntoday says, our predecessor gurus.\nSo this is the verse and purport that I am going to read in this connection. It's the 7th Canto of Srimad \nBhagavatam, 15th chapter, 45th verse.\nyavan nr-kaya-ratham atma-vasopakalpam\ndhatte garistha-caranarcanaya nisatam\njnanasim acyuta-balo dadhad asta-satruh\nsvananda-tusta upasanta idam vijahyat\nTRANSLATION\nAs long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and paraphernalia, which are \nnot fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, namely his spiritual \nmaster and the spiritual master's predecessors. By their mercy, one can sharpen the sword of \nknowledge, and with the power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's mercy one must then \nconquer the enemies mentioned above. In this way, the devotee should be able to merge into his \nown transcendental bliss, and then he may give up his body and resume his spiritual identity.\nThis verse refers to the enemies mentioned in the previous verse. So in order to more fully understand \nwhat this verse is talking about one should know what these enemies are. And this is the previous verse.\nIn the conditioned stage, one's conceptions of life are sometimes polluted by passion and \nignorance, which are exhibited by attachment, hostility, greed, lamentation, illusion, fear, \nmadness, false prestige, insults, fault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, \nbewilderment, hunger and sleep. All of these are enemies. Sometimes one's conceptions are also \npolluted by goodness. (SB 7.15.43–44)\nIs there anyone who thinks that these enemies that we've listed have all been conquered? I'll read them \none more time.\nAttachment. One by one. Hostility. Greed. Lamentation, illusion, fear, madness, false prestige, insult, \nfault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, bewilderment, hunger, sleep. All of these are \nenemies.\nBy the strength of our own intelligence, to some degree, we may be able to deal with some of these \nenemies. But Prabhupada is going to make the point very clear in the purport that simply by knowledge\nitself one cannot cut away from these enemies.\nKrsna says clearly that the living entities in the material world are struggling very hard with material \nexistence. None of us can say, \"I'm not struggling with these things.\".\n\nOftentimes devotees ask me how to deal with the fact that they are struggling with Krsna \nconsciousness. I say to them, \"You're struggling?! It's good that you're struggling. As soon as you stop \nstruggling you're finished.\" If we're struggling it means that we want to overcome these bad influences. \nThose who don't want to overcome them, think it's natural to be lusty. It's natural to be envious. They \ndon't think they are in illusion because they think illusion is reality.\nWe should therefore struggle to find the spiritual strength to overcome these enemies. That much \nstruggling we have to do. If we don't struggle for that, we'll have to struggle with material nature, \nwhich is very hard on the living entity, and causes so much anxiety.\nPrabhupada says that this material world is kuntha. It is a place of anxiety. It cannot be avoided. \nEverything in this world is temporary and the eternal living entity is going to have to be in anxiety \nabout losing that which he is attached to. So he struggles with this illusory energy.\nA devotee therefore prays. \"Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare/ Hare Rama Hare Rama \nRama Rama Hare Hare.\" He's praying to Krsna. He's praying to Lord Balarama. \"Please give me the \nstrength so that I may be engaged in Krsna's service.\" He's praying to Srimati Radharani. Please engage\nme in Krsna's service. He's looking for strength. This is his struggle.\nSo just as this verse states that \"As long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and\nparaphernalia, which are not fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, \nnamely his spiritual master and the spiritual master's predecessors.\"\nSo let me read the purport. Please take note of the emphasis Srila Prabhupada is making about strength.\nIt's a little bit long. Try to listen carefully.\nIn Bhagavad-gita (4.9) the Lord says:\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\" This is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\nIn other words, this is what it means to accept help from the superiors is to go back home, back to \nGodhead. This is the destination that Krsna wants all living entities to achieve. And Lord Balarama and\nthose in the line of Lord Balarama are meant to give us the strength to go back to the spiritual world.\nThis is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\n... to go back home, back to Godhead.\nIt is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.20.17):\nnr-deham adyam sulabham sudurlabham\nplavam sukalpam guru-karnadharam\n\nmayanukulena nabhasvateritam\npuman bhavabdhim na taret sa atma-ha\nThis human form of body is a most valuable boat, and the spiritual master is the captain, guru-\nkarnadharam, to guide the boat in plying across the ocean of nescience. The instruction of Krsna \nis a favorable breeze. One must use all these facilities to cross over the ocean of nescience. Since \nthe spiritual master is the captain, one must serve the spiritual master very sincerely so that by his\nmercy one will be able to get the mercy of the Supreme Lord.\nA significant word here is acyuta-balah. The spiritual master is certainly very merciful to his \ndisciples, and consequently by satisfying him a devotee gets strength from the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore says, guru-krsna-prasade paya \nbhakti-lata-bija: [Cc. Madhya 19.151] one must first please the spiritual master, and then one \nautomatically pleases Krsna and gets the strength with which to cross the ocean of nescience.\nThis is the point I was making before. Simply knowledge, is insufficient. One can study the Vedas for \nmillions of births, as Lord Brahma says in Brahma Samhita, and still never be able to understand \nKrsna. So it's not simply by knowledge that one can cross the ocean of material existence.\nThe purport continues:\nIf one seriously desires to return home, back to Godhead, one must therefore become strong \nenough by pleasing the spiritual master, for thus one gets the weapon with which to conquer the \nenemy, and one also gets the grace of Krsna. Simply getting the weapon of jnana is insufficient. \nOne must sharpen the weapon by serving the spiritual master and adhering to his instructions. \nThen the candidate will get the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nPrabhupada then gives a nice analogy.\nIn general warfare one must take help from his chariot and horses in order to conquer his enemy, \nand after conquering his enemies he may give up the chariot and its paraphernalia. Similarly, as \nlong as one has a human body, one should fully use it to obtain the highest perfection of life, \nnamely going back home, back to Godhead.\nUsing the human form of life to its full potential.\nkamasya nendriya-pritir\nlabho jiveta yavata\njivasya tattva-jijnasa\nnartho yas ceha karmabhih\nLife's desires should never be directed toward sense gratification. One should desire only a healthy life,\nor self-preservation, since a human being is meant for inquiry about the Absolute Truth. Nothing else \nshould be the goal of one's works. (SB 1.2.10)\nThe perfection of knowledge is certainly to become transcendentally situated (brahma-bhuta [SB \n4.30.20]). As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):\n\nbrahma-bhutah prasannatma\nna socati na kanksati\nsamah sarvesu bhutesu\nmad-bhaktim labhate param\n\"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully \njoyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living \nentities. In that state he attains pure devotional service.\" Simply by cultivating knowledge as the \nimpersonalists do, one cannot get out of the clutches of maya. One must attain the platform of \nbhakti.\nbhaktya mam abhijanati\nyavan yas casmi tattvatah\ntato mam tattvato jnatva\nvisate tad-anantaram\n\"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one \nis in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of \nGod.\" (Bg. 18.55) Unless one has attained the stage of devotional service and the mercy of the \nspiritual master and Krsna, there is a possibility that one may fall down and again accept a \nmaterial body. Therefore Krsna stresses in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\"\nThe word tattvatah, meaning \"in reality,\" is very important. Tato mam tattvato jnatva. Unless one \nunderstands Krsna in truth by the mercy of the spiritual master, one is not free to give up his \nmaterial body.\nIn other words, one has to accept another material body.\n4\nAs it is said, aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah: [SB \n10.2.32] if one neglects to serve the lotus feet of Krsna, one cannot become free from the material\nclutches simply by knowledge. Even if one attains the stage of brahma-padam, merging in \nBrahman, without bhakti he is prone to fall down. One must be very careful in regard to the \ndanger of falling down again into material bondage. The only insurance is to come to the stage of \nbhakti, from which one is sure not to fall. Then one is free from the activities of the material \nworld. In summary, as stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, one must get in touch with a bona fide\nspiritual master coming in the parampara of Krsna consciousness, for by his mercy and \n\ninstructions one is able to get strength from Krsna. Thus one engages in devotional service and \nattains the ultimate goal of life, the lotus feet of Visnu.\nSignificant in this verse are the words jnanasim acyuta-balah. Jnanasim, the sword of knowledge, \nis given by Krsna, and when one serves the guru and Krsna in order to hold the sword of Krsna's \ninstructions, Balarama gives one strength. Balarama is Nityananda. Vrajendra-nandana yei, saci-\nsuta haila sei, balarama ha-ila nitai. This bala -- Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya \nMahaprabhu, and both of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take \nshelter of Their lotus feet. They come especially to deliver the fallen souls of this age, papi tapi \nyata chila, hari-name uddharila. Their weapon is sankirtana, hari-nama. Thus one should accept \nthe sword of knowledge from Krsna and be strong with the mercy of Balarama. We are therefore \nworshiping Krsna-Balarama in Vrndavana. In the Mundaka Upanisad (3.2.4) it is said:\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvams\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nOne cannot attain the goal of life without the mercy of Balarama. Sri Narottama dasa Thakura \ntherefore says, nitaiyera karuna habe, vraje radha-krsna pabe: when one receives the mercy of \nBalarama, Nityananda, one can attain the lotus feet of Radha and Krsna very easily.\nse sambandha nahi yara,   \nbrtha janma gela tara,\nvidya-kule hi karibe tara\nIf one has no connection with Nitai, Balarama, then even though one is a very learned scholar or \njnani or has taken birth in a very respectable family, these assets will not help him. We must \ntherefore conquer the enemies of Krsna consciousness with the strength received from Balarama. \n[end of purport]\nThese enemies are like whips. They are beating us again and again, keeping us in the bodily \nidentification. Imagine living with enemies. We are living with enemies right in our own bodies.\nKrsna described the enemy as lust. When Arjuna asked Krsna, \"What is it Krsna that compels a person \nto act even against his own will?\" Krsna replied that \"It's lust only Arjuna which is later transformed in \nanger, which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world.\" How to conquer this enemy on our own \nstrength?\nThose who try to do it on the strength of their own intelligence,\ntvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\n (SB 10.2.32)\n\n[...]their intelligence is impure. They fall down from their position of imagined superiority because \nthey have no regard for Your lotus feet.\nThey are destined to fall, because they haven't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus feet. They haven't taken \nshelter of Lord Balarama. They haven't taken shelter of bhakti, which manifests through the mercy of \nthe spiritual and the predecessor spiritual masters.\nThe spiritual master must represent the predecessor spiritual masters. Only by representing the \npredecessor spiritual master can one strive to achieve the Lord by the right means.\nThe verse nayam atma bala hinena labhyo clearly states that one has to achieve the Lord by the right \nmeans. One should not be wild or careless. By the right means Krsna reveals Himself and one enters \nthe spiritual world.\n5\nThis is the meaning of akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda guru tattva means that Lord Balarama manifests \nHimself as guru in an unlimited variety of forms. And it is the service of guru to give one the strength \nto cross over the ocean of material existence to enter into the spiritual world.\nSo this is how we worship Lord Balarama on His appearance day. We should know that He is adi-guru. \nHe is the original guru and and all other gurus represent Him. Without His mercy, without taking \nshelter of Him, we will never be able to give up this sense gratification and attachment to the material \nworld.\nAs described in the song Gauranga Bolite Ha'be, Narottama das Thakur is praying.\nara kabe nitai-candera karuna karibe\nsamsara-vasana mora kabe tuccha habe\n\"When will Lord Nityananda have mercy upon me so that I can realize the uselessness of material \npleasure?'\nHe is praying in that way. Who is Nityananda? He is Lord Balarama. Nityananda is the same as Lord \nBalarama. He has appeared to serve Lord Caitanya in the same way as Lord Balarama has appeared to \nserve Lord Krsna.\nAnd as Prabhupada says in today's purport, \"Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and \nboth of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take shelter of Their lotus \nfeet.\"\nWhat is their weapon?\nkrsna-varnam tvisakrsnam\nsangopangastra-parsadam\nSB 11.5.32\nThe verse describes how Lord Caitanya appears with His weapons. What is Lord Caitanya's weapon? \nHe's not coming to chop off heads. Not coming with a club to beat and destroy. He's coming with the \nweapon of harinama sankirtan. That is the weapon He has come with in this age of Kali.\n\nSrila Bhaktisiddhanti Sarasvati Thakur describes in one article of the Harmonist Magazine.\n\"Nityananda alone possesses the distinctive function of the guru. In Nityananda the function is \nembodied. Nityananda is the servant-God. He serves Sri Gaurasundara by the distinctive method of \nreverential servitude. He is identical with Sri Balarama of krsna-lila.[...]\n[...]\"But Nityananda does not directly instruct in the confidential service of Krsna. Srimati Radhika is \nthe guru of the inner circle of the servants of Krsna. Srimati Radhika, however, accepts the offer of \nservice of only those souls who are specially favored by Nityananda and are deemed by Him to be fit \nfor Her service.\nSo in all respects we are dependent upon the mercy of Nityananda Balarama to become qualifided to \ndance in the spiritual world and to be fully engaged in loving devotional service to the Lord.\nThis is the goal. Prabhupada clearly states this right from the outset of the verse. The goal is to go back \nhome, back to Godhead. The goal is not to be happy in this material world.\nThe devotee who understands this goal may become happy in this world. But as Rupa Goswami says, \nthere is three types of happiness. 1) Happiness derived from sense gratification, which is temporary. 2) \nHappiness which comes from liberation, which can also be temporary.\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\nOne will fall down from his position of imagined superiority if he hasn't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus \nfeet. And 3) The happiness which comes from bhakti, by realizing\njivera 'svarupa' haya -- krsnera 'nitya-dasa'\nI am Krsna's eternal servant, and my only business in life is to find shelter at His lotus feet. This is real \nhappiness.\nBy the mercy of guru, by the mercy of predecessor gurus, and by the mercy of Lord Balarama. This is \nwhat it means to take shelter. And this is why we observe Lord Balarama's appearance day... to pray for\nthis strength.\nHare Krsna","attachment_name":"balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf","attachment_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/sites/default/files/attachments/balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf"},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"ru":{"title":"26 августа, 2018 - Алматы, Казахстан - Лекция на Баларама Пурниме - Английский/ Русский","event":"Festival","topic":"Шримад Бхагаватам","translation":"Русский","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"","attachment_name":""},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"counters":{"audio_page_view":0,"audio_play_count":0,"downloads":"147","video_page_view":0,"en_transcription_view":0,"ru_transcription_view":0,"en_summary_view":0,"ru_summary_view":0}},{"uuid":"1f8bcffa-5bd8-42c3-b89d-081bfb0e3fe4","needs_translation":true,"created_date":"2018-08-26","published_date":"","author":"Niranjana Swami","part":"7","chapter":"15","verse":"45","download_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/download/33355","lecture_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/en/lecture/26495","duration":"01:37:59","downloads":"147","audio_link":"https://nrs-site.s3.amazonaws.com/lectures/2018/2018-08/niranjana_swami_-_sb_7.15.45_on_balarama-purnima_-c2a0almaty_26-aug-2018.mp3","soundCloud_link":"https://soundcloud.com/niranjana-swami/august-26-2018-almaty","youtube":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsg2S32qsdM?rel=gallery-all&wmode=opaque&autoplay=0"],"en":{"title":"August 26, 2018 - Almaty, Kazakhstan - Balarama Purnima Class - English/ Russian","event":"Festival","topic":"Srimad Bhagavatam","translation":"Russian","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"\n\nTranscription of a Lecture Given on Balarama Purnima, August 26, 2018, in Almaty, Kazakhstan\nThe following is a partially-edited lecture given in Almaty, Kazakhstan on Balarama Purnima, August \n26, 2018\nToday we are observing the appearance of Lord Balarama. I will first speak about, \"Who is Lord \nBalarama?.\" I will then speak on a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam in which Srila Prabhupada speaks \nabout the necessity of getting spiritual strength from Lord Balarama.\nLord Balarama is the first expansion of Lord Krsna called a svamsa expansion. There's very little \ndifference between Krsna and Balarama. They are both the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nSome of the differences are that is Krsna is blackish like the monsoon raincloud and Balarama is white.\nKrsna plays a flute and Balarama plays a buffalo horn. Sometimes Balarama carries a flute but most \noften He carries a buffalo horn in Vrndavana. Balarama sometimes carries a plow and club.\nBalarama manifested in Vrndavana as Krsna's elder brother. He first appeared in the womb of Devaki \nand later, by the arrangement of Yogamaya, He was transferred to the womb on Rohini. In Vrndavana, \nBalarama is known as Rohininandana, the son of Rohini.\nOutside of Vrndavana, Lord Balarama is manifest as Mula-sankarsana. Mula-sankarsana is the first \nexpansion coming from Lord Balarama. When Lord Balarama appeared in Vrndavana in the womb of \nRohini, this Mula-sankarsana became drawn to Him and appeared within Him. This is explained in \nGopal Campu. Just as Krsna never leaves Vrndavana, Balarama never leaves Vrndavana.\nFrom Lord Balarama manifests His plenary expansions beginning with Mula-sankarsana. As Mula-\nsankarsana, Balarama is manifest outside of Vrndavana in Mathura and Dwaraka.\nFrom Balarama also comes all living entities. Even the nitya-siddhas in the spiritual world, all of \nKrsna's devotees who are either in santa rasa, dasya rasa, sakyha rasa or vatsalya rasa are all coming \nfrom Lord Balarama. Vrndavana is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama. In fact, the whole \ndhama is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama.\nSo Balarama serves Krsna by providing all this for Krsna's pleasure in the spiritual world. Those in \nconjugal rasa, the gopis, are expansions coming from Srimati Radharani.\nIn this way, all of Krsna's eternal associates, Krsna parisada, are manifestations coming from either \nLord Balarama or Srimati Radharani in the spiritual world.\nMula-sankarsana further expands as Maha-sankarsana. As Maha-sankarsana He becomes the source of \nall of the living entities who are serving Krsna in Vaikuntha.\nWhen we say, \"From Lord Balarama comes\", it suggests that at one time, within time, the living entities\nmanifested from Lord Balarama. But we should know that being under the influence of material time, \nthese things are difficult to conceive in the material world.\n\nFor instance, Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita to Arjuna, \"Never was there a time when you did not exist, \nnever was there a time when all these kings assembled in the battlefield did not exist, never was there a \ntime when I did not exist, nor in the future will any of us cease to be.\" (BG 2.12)\nSo when we say that the living entities are all emanations or expansions coming from Lord Balarama, \nimmediately we have a tendency to think, \"Oh at some point in time, they manifested.\" However, they \nare all eternally manifest.\nJust as Krsna, as stated in Brahma Samhita, is beginningless. Lord Brahma says that Krsna is advaitam \nacyutam, anadim, ananta-rupam. He is nondual. His body is never subject to decay. He is the \nbeginning. He has no end. He is the source of everything. So beginningless means, never was there a \ntime when He did not exist.\nIn the same way, never was there a time when Lord Balarama did not exist. Never was there a time \nwhen all of Krsna's eternal associates did not exist, and the living entities, the jivas, never was there a \ntime when they did not exist. Krsna's energies are always existing simultaneously along with Krsna.\nJust like this material world goes through cycles. It's manifest, it stays for some time and then \nunmanifest. But this manifestation and unmanifestation is an eternal process without beginning or end.\nIf I give you a little time to think about it— just a little time. Never was there a time when Krsna, \nBalarama, the living entities did not exist. This cannot be understood by the limited mind. As long as \nwe are under the influence of time, it is very difficult to understand that which is existing in eternal \ntime.\nKrsna says \"the spiritual world is unmanifest, infallible, and it is the supreme destination. When one \ngoes there he never has to come back. \"When Krsna says that the spiritual world is unmanifest, does it \nmean that it doesn't exist? No. Never was there a time when it manifested. It's eternal. And Krsna says \nthat when one goes there, he never comes back. Tad dhama paramam mama. \"That is My supreme \nabode.\" (BG 8.21)\nSo, as we said, Balarama is the first expansion coming from Krsna. But when did Balarama expand \nfrom Krsna? And when did Maha-sankarsana, Mula-sankarsana expand from the original Balarama? \nAnd when from the Mula-sankarsana did Maha-sankarsana manifest in order to manifest the Vaikuntha \nplanets and all of Krsna's servants in the Vaikuntha planets who serve Him in His various forms? We \ncannot say when it happened. We only use those terms because we think in those terms. And we won't \nbe able to fully understand until we go beyond the influence of time ourselves. Those who are beyond \nthe influence of time, for them, time is ever-present. Krsna's pastimes and Balarama's pastimes in the \nspiritual world are eternally manifest.\nTime is also manifest in the spiritual world. But there it exists to assist Krsna and Balarama in Their \npastimes. There is no destructive feature of time in the spiritual world.\nEvery morning, Krsna, Balarama, and Their cowherd boyfriends after breakfast and milking the cows, \ngo out to the pastures. During the day when the sun is fully manifest in the sky, They along with the \ncowherd boys take shelter in the caves of Govardhana. As the sun continues to pass, later in the evening\nKrsna and Balarama with Their cowherd boyfriends and the cows, return to Gokula.\n\n2\nIn the spiritual world, time is manifest just to assist Krsna in His pastimes. But there is no destructive \nfeature of time as time destroys everything in the material world.\nKrsna tells Arjuna when He manifested the universal form, \"kalo 'smi loka-ksaya-krt pravrddho\", Time \nI am, the great destroyer of the worlds.\" (BG 11.32)\nSo when Krsna creates this material world, first He creates time. That's how creation takes place. \nOtherwise how could creation take place if there was no time? So when it's time for unmanifested \nmaterial elements to manifest as the external energy, time first appears.\nThen from Maha-sankarsana, as we said, in the spiritual world comes Karanadakasayi Visnu, who is \nalso a manifestation of Lord Balarama. And from Karandakasayi Visnu comes Garbodakasayi Visnu \nwho enters into each universe, which are generated from Karanadakasayi Visnu. And from \nGarbodakasayi Visnu who lies in the Garbodaka Ocean, comes the first created being in the universe, \nLord Brahma.\nThey are all expansions coming from Lord Balarama. Then there is Ksirodakasayi Visnu, who is also \nthe supersoul, manifested in the heart of all living beings. After the manifestation of Ksirodakasayi \nVisnu, comes Sesa who is a manifestation of the Lord who serves the Lord in various ways in this \nworld.\nAnanta-sesa, on each of His hoods, holds material universes. That's spiritual strength. Imagine holding \nunlimited universes on your hoods, and you standing on nothing? Try to conceive. It's inconceivable.\nSo Ananta-sea is holding all the universes on his different hoods but he rests on nothing. He is self-\nsufficient. And He is a manifestation of Lord Balarama.\nThere are two manifestations of Sesa. There's Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods, and \nthen there is the Ananta-sesa who is the bed of Lord Visnu. In the Laghu-bhagavatamrita Rupa \nGoswami explains that the Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods is an avesa avatara of \nLord Balarama. He is saktyavesa. He's an empowered jiva who holds the universe on his heads as \nAnanta-sesa.\nThe other manifestation of Sesa is a plenary expansion of Lord Balarama upon whom Lord Visnu lies.\nAnanta-sesa serves Lord Krsna, just as Lord Balarama is serving Lord Krsna in all of these different \nforms in the matter of creation and maintenance of this cosmic manifestation. Ananta-sesa is also \nmanifest as Krsna's pillow, Krsna's shoes, Krsna's bed, Krsna's sacred thread, Krsna's garments, etc.. In \nthis way, Ananta-sesa is rendering service to Krsna.\nSo Lord Balarama, in His different manifestations, is rendering service to Krsna in unlimited ways. \nEven though Lord Balarama is Krsna Himself, He is always absorbed in the mood of, \"I am Krsna's \nservant.\"\nLord Balarama's service mood towards Krsna is described as sankula, or mixed. He is Krsna's friend. \nKrsna goes out with his cowherd boyfriends. Lord Balarama is going with Him into the pasturing \n\ngrounds. He's Krsna's servant as we already described in various ways how Lord Balarama renders \nservice to Krsna. And He also has a mood of vatsalya, because He is Krsna's older brother.\nIn Vedic culture, ancient culture, the older brother is always worshipped and respected as one's \nsuperior. So Balarama also has this vatsalya mood of protecting Krsna.\nWhen Balarama and Krsna entered into the forest of Dhenukasura, Krsna spoke about Lord Balarama \nas follows:\n\"O greatest of Lords, just see how these trees are bowing their heads at Your lotus feet, which are \nworshipable by the immortal demigods. The trees are offering You their fruits and flowers to eradicate \nthe dark ignorance that has caused their birth as trees.\" (SB 10.15.5)\nSo Krsna is considering Balarama His superior. In the forest of Dhenukasura, Balarama is lying down \nwith His head on the lap of the cowherd boys and Krsna is taking Balarama's lotus feet and is \nmassaging them. So Balarama also serves Krsna in this vatsalya mood and is treated as a superior by \nKrsna. Balarama also serves Krsna in madhurya-rasa. But to do that, He is manifested as Ananga-\nmanjari, the sister of Radharani.\nBalarama is also considered Adi-guru. Adi-guru means the original guru. Just as Krsna treats Balarama \nas a superior, He also treats Him as guru. Balarama is akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda means unlimited. \nIn other words, Balarama is the guru that manifests in unlimited forms to serve as guru. And all gurus \nare understood to be representatives of Lord Balarama, who is the source of spiritual strength.\nPrabhupada explains in Krsna book. \"In the Upanisad it is stated, nayam atma bala-hinena labhyah. The\npurport is that one cannot attain the supreme platform of self-realization without being sufficiently \nfavored by Balarama. Bala does not mean physical strength. No one can attain spiritual perfection by \nphysical strength. One must have the spiritual strength which is infused by Balarama, or Sankarsana. \nAnanta, or Sesa, is the power which sustains all the planets in their different positions. Materially this \nsustaining power is known as the law of gravitation, but actually it is a display of the potency of \nSankarsana. Balarama, or Sankarsana, is spiritual power, or the original spiritual master. Therefore \nLord Nityananda Prabhu, who is also the incarnation of Balarama, is the original spiritual master. And \nthe spiritual master is the representative of Balarama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who \nsupplies spiritual strength. In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is confirmed that the spiritual master is the \nmanifestation of the mercy of Krsna.\" (Krsna Book Ch. 2)\nSo Prabhupada refers to the verse from the Mundaka Upanisad.\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvan\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nThis verse means, \"The Supreme Lord cannot be attained by one who has no spiritual strength, one \nwho is careless or wild, or whose austerites are inappropriate. The Lord appears before a person who \nstrives by the right means to attain Him. Such a person enters the spiritual world.\"\n\nOne requires spiritual strength in order to understand Krsna and to enter the spiritual world. \nPrabhupada says that we are not talking about physical strength. Spiritual strength is the strength to \novercome the influence of the modes of material nature, to cross the ocean of material existence, and to\nbecome qualified to enter into that supreme abode which is unmanifest and infallible.\nWho is the source of spiritual strength? It is Balarama who is akhanda guru tattva. He manifests \nHimself in various forms in order to give strength to the living entities in the material world so they can\nfind the determination, courage, and satisfaction to overcome the stringent laws of material nature and \nto achieve entrance into that eternal abode.\nAs the Mundaka Upanisad says, \"Krsna manifests Himself to that person who strives to achieve Him \nby the right means.\" What is the right means?\nThat is the verse we wanted to read today from Srimad Bhagavatam. This verse speaks about the right \nmeans to cross the ocean of material existence, by getting strength from the spiritual master and \npredecessor spiritual masters.\nHow can we overcome the illusory energy by our own strength? A devotee never thinks, \"I am \nspiritually strong by my own endeavors.\" He knows that whatever spiritual strength he has, has been \ngiven to him because he is taking shelter of spiritual strength.\nJust as one takes shelter of Krsna consciousness,\nkrsna -- surya-sama, maya haya andhakara\nyahan krsna, tahan nahi mayara adhikara\n\"Krsna is compared to sunshine, and maya is compared to darkness. Wherever there is sunshine, there \ncannot be darkness. As soon as one takes to Krsna consciousness, the darkness of illusion (the influence\nof the external energy) will immediately vanish. (Madhya 22.31)\nWherever there is Krsna, there cannot be maya. Wherever there is Krsna consciousness, there cannot be\nthe influence of illusion. But we cannot manifest Krsna before us by our own strength.\nSrimad Bhagavatam states:\nathapi te deva padambuja-dvaya-\nprasada-lesanugrhita eva hi\njanati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno\nna canya eko 'pi ciram vicinvan\nMy Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the \ngreatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years. (SB \n10.14.29)\nUnless one gets that drop of mercy he cannot understand.\n3\nKrsna tells Arjuna,\n\nMy dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before \nyou, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My \nunderstanding. (Bg 11.54)\nTherefore the knowledge and strength to cross over the material existence is coming from Krsna and \nBalarama. Balarama is Adi-guru, the original guru, He is the original source of all spiritual strength. If \none wishes to get spiritual strength, he must take shelter of guru and as this verse we are going to read \ntoday says, our predecessor gurus.\nSo this is the verse and purport that I am going to read in this connection. It's the 7th Canto of Srimad \nBhagavatam, 15th chapter, 45th verse.\nyavan nr-kaya-ratham atma-vasopakalpam\ndhatte garistha-caranarcanaya nisatam\njnanasim acyuta-balo dadhad asta-satruh\nsvananda-tusta upasanta idam vijahyat\nTRANSLATION\nAs long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and paraphernalia, which are \nnot fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, namely his spiritual \nmaster and the spiritual master's predecessors. By their mercy, one can sharpen the sword of \nknowledge, and with the power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's mercy one must then \nconquer the enemies mentioned above. In this way, the devotee should be able to merge into his \nown transcendental bliss, and then he may give up his body and resume his spiritual identity.\nThis verse refers to the enemies mentioned in the previous verse. So in order to more fully understand \nwhat this verse is talking about one should know what these enemies are. And this is the previous verse.\nIn the conditioned stage, one's conceptions of life are sometimes polluted by passion and \nignorance, which are exhibited by attachment, hostility, greed, lamentation, illusion, fear, \nmadness, false prestige, insults, fault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, \nbewilderment, hunger and sleep. All of these are enemies. Sometimes one's conceptions are also \npolluted by goodness. (SB 7.15.43–44)\nIs there anyone who thinks that these enemies that we've listed have all been conquered? I'll read them \none more time.\nAttachment. One by one. Hostility. Greed. Lamentation, illusion, fear, madness, false prestige, insult, \nfault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, bewilderment, hunger, sleep. All of these are \nenemies.\nBy the strength of our own intelligence, to some degree, we may be able to deal with some of these \nenemies. But Prabhupada is going to make the point very clear in the purport that simply by knowledge\nitself one cannot cut away from these enemies.\nKrsna says clearly that the living entities in the material world are struggling very hard with material \nexistence. None of us can say, \"I'm not struggling with these things.\".\n\nOftentimes devotees ask me how to deal with the fact that they are struggling with Krsna \nconsciousness. I say to them, \"You're struggling?! It's good that you're struggling. As soon as you stop \nstruggling you're finished.\" If we're struggling it means that we want to overcome these bad influences. \nThose who don't want to overcome them, think it's natural to be lusty. It's natural to be envious. They \ndon't think they are in illusion because they think illusion is reality.\nWe should therefore struggle to find the spiritual strength to overcome these enemies. That much \nstruggling we have to do. If we don't struggle for that, we'll have to struggle with material nature, \nwhich is very hard on the living entity, and causes so much anxiety.\nPrabhupada says that this material world is kuntha. It is a place of anxiety. It cannot be avoided. \nEverything in this world is temporary and the eternal living entity is going to have to be in anxiety \nabout losing that which he is attached to. So he struggles with this illusory energy.\nA devotee therefore prays. \"Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare/ Hare Rama Hare Rama \nRama Rama Hare Hare.\" He's praying to Krsna. He's praying to Lord Balarama. \"Please give me the \nstrength so that I may be engaged in Krsna's service.\" He's praying to Srimati Radharani. Please engage\nme in Krsna's service. He's looking for strength. This is his struggle.\nSo just as this verse states that \"As long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and\nparaphernalia, which are not fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, \nnamely his spiritual master and the spiritual master's predecessors.\"\nSo let me read the purport. Please take note of the emphasis Srila Prabhupada is making about strength.\nIt's a little bit long. Try to listen carefully.\nIn Bhagavad-gita (4.9) the Lord says:\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\" This is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\nIn other words, this is what it means to accept help from the superiors is to go back home, back to \nGodhead. This is the destination that Krsna wants all living entities to achieve. And Lord Balarama and\nthose in the line of Lord Balarama are meant to give us the strength to go back to the spiritual world.\nThis is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\n... to go back home, back to Godhead.\nIt is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.20.17):\nnr-deham adyam sulabham sudurlabham\nplavam sukalpam guru-karnadharam\n\nmayanukulena nabhasvateritam\npuman bhavabdhim na taret sa atma-ha\nThis human form of body is a most valuable boat, and the spiritual master is the captain, guru-\nkarnadharam, to guide the boat in plying across the ocean of nescience. The instruction of Krsna \nis a favorable breeze. One must use all these facilities to cross over the ocean of nescience. Since \nthe spiritual master is the captain, one must serve the spiritual master very sincerely so that by his\nmercy one will be able to get the mercy of the Supreme Lord.\nA significant word here is acyuta-balah. The spiritual master is certainly very merciful to his \ndisciples, and consequently by satisfying him a devotee gets strength from the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore says, guru-krsna-prasade paya \nbhakti-lata-bija: [Cc. Madhya 19.151] one must first please the spiritual master, and then one \nautomatically pleases Krsna and gets the strength with which to cross the ocean of nescience.\nThis is the point I was making before. Simply knowledge, is insufficient. One can study the Vedas for \nmillions of births, as Lord Brahma says in Brahma Samhita, and still never be able to understand \nKrsna. So it's not simply by knowledge that one can cross the ocean of material existence.\nThe purport continues:\nIf one seriously desires to return home, back to Godhead, one must therefore become strong \nenough by pleasing the spiritual master, for thus one gets the weapon with which to conquer the \nenemy, and one also gets the grace of Krsna. Simply getting the weapon of jnana is insufficient. \nOne must sharpen the weapon by serving the spiritual master and adhering to his instructions. \nThen the candidate will get the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nPrabhupada then gives a nice analogy.\nIn general warfare one must take help from his chariot and horses in order to conquer his enemy, \nand after conquering his enemies he may give up the chariot and its paraphernalia. Similarly, as \nlong as one has a human body, one should fully use it to obtain the highest perfection of life, \nnamely going back home, back to Godhead.\nUsing the human form of life to its full potential.\nkamasya nendriya-pritir\nlabho jiveta yavata\njivasya tattva-jijnasa\nnartho yas ceha karmabhih\nLife's desires should never be directed toward sense gratification. One should desire only a healthy life,\nor self-preservation, since a human being is meant for inquiry about the Absolute Truth. Nothing else \nshould be the goal of one's works. (SB 1.2.10)\nThe perfection of knowledge is certainly to become transcendentally situated (brahma-bhuta [SB \n4.30.20]). As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):\n\nbrahma-bhutah prasannatma\nna socati na kanksati\nsamah sarvesu bhutesu\nmad-bhaktim labhate param\n\"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully \njoyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living \nentities. In that state he attains pure devotional service.\" Simply by cultivating knowledge as the \nimpersonalists do, one cannot get out of the clutches of maya. One must attain the platform of \nbhakti.\nbhaktya mam abhijanati\nyavan yas casmi tattvatah\ntato mam tattvato jnatva\nvisate tad-anantaram\n\"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one \nis in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of \nGod.\" (Bg. 18.55) Unless one has attained the stage of devotional service and the mercy of the \nspiritual master and Krsna, there is a possibility that one may fall down and again accept a \nmaterial body. Therefore Krsna stresses in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\"\nThe word tattvatah, meaning \"in reality,\" is very important. Tato mam tattvato jnatva. Unless one \nunderstands Krsna in truth by the mercy of the spiritual master, one is not free to give up his \nmaterial body.\nIn other words, one has to accept another material body.\n4\nAs it is said, aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah: [SB \n10.2.32] if one neglects to serve the lotus feet of Krsna, one cannot become free from the material\nclutches simply by knowledge. Even if one attains the stage of brahma-padam, merging in \nBrahman, without bhakti he is prone to fall down. One must be very careful in regard to the \ndanger of falling down again into material bondage. The only insurance is to come to the stage of \nbhakti, from which one is sure not to fall. Then one is free from the activities of the material \nworld. In summary, as stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, one must get in touch with a bona fide\nspiritual master coming in the parampara of Krsna consciousness, for by his mercy and \n\ninstructions one is able to get strength from Krsna. Thus one engages in devotional service and \nattains the ultimate goal of life, the lotus feet of Visnu.\nSignificant in this verse are the words jnanasim acyuta-balah. Jnanasim, the sword of knowledge, \nis given by Krsna, and when one serves the guru and Krsna in order to hold the sword of Krsna's \ninstructions, Balarama gives one strength. Balarama is Nityananda. Vrajendra-nandana yei, saci-\nsuta haila sei, balarama ha-ila nitai. This bala -- Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya \nMahaprabhu, and both of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take \nshelter of Their lotus feet. They come especially to deliver the fallen souls of this age, papi tapi \nyata chila, hari-name uddharila. Their weapon is sankirtana, hari-nama. Thus one should accept \nthe sword of knowledge from Krsna and be strong with the mercy of Balarama. We are therefore \nworshiping Krsna-Balarama in Vrndavana. In the Mundaka Upanisad (3.2.4) it is said:\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvams\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nOne cannot attain the goal of life without the mercy of Balarama. Sri Narottama dasa Thakura \ntherefore says, nitaiyera karuna habe, vraje radha-krsna pabe: when one receives the mercy of \nBalarama, Nityananda, one can attain the lotus feet of Radha and Krsna very easily.\nse sambandha nahi yara,   \nbrtha janma gela tara,\nvidya-kule hi karibe tara\nIf one has no connection with Nitai, Balarama, then even though one is a very learned scholar or \njnani or has taken birth in a very respectable family, these assets will not help him. We must \ntherefore conquer the enemies of Krsna consciousness with the strength received from Balarama. \n[end of purport]\nThese enemies are like whips. They are beating us again and again, keeping us in the bodily \nidentification. Imagine living with enemies. We are living with enemies right in our own bodies.\nKrsna described the enemy as lust. When Arjuna asked Krsna, \"What is it Krsna that compels a person \nto act even against his own will?\" Krsna replied that \"It's lust only Arjuna which is later transformed in \nanger, which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world.\" How to conquer this enemy on our own \nstrength?\nThose who try to do it on the strength of their own intelligence,\ntvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\n (SB 10.2.32)\n\n[...]their intelligence is impure. They fall down from their position of imagined superiority because \nthey have no regard for Your lotus feet.\nThey are destined to fall, because they haven't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus feet. They haven't taken \nshelter of Lord Balarama. They haven't taken shelter of bhakti, which manifests through the mercy of \nthe spiritual and the predecessor spiritual masters.\nThe spiritual master must represent the predecessor spiritual masters. Only by representing the \npredecessor spiritual master can one strive to achieve the Lord by the right means.\nThe verse nayam atma bala hinena labhyo clearly states that one has to achieve the Lord by the right \nmeans. One should not be wild or careless. By the right means Krsna reveals Himself and one enters \nthe spiritual world.\n5\nThis is the meaning of akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda guru tattva means that Lord Balarama manifests \nHimself as guru in an unlimited variety of forms. And it is the service of guru to give one the strength \nto cross over the ocean of material existence to enter into the spiritual world.\nSo this is how we worship Lord Balarama on His appearance day. We should know that He is adi-guru. \nHe is the original guru and and all other gurus represent Him. Without His mercy, without taking \nshelter of Him, we will never be able to give up this sense gratification and attachment to the material \nworld.\nAs described in the song Gauranga Bolite Ha'be, Narottama das Thakur is praying.\nara kabe nitai-candera karuna karibe\nsamsara-vasana mora kabe tuccha habe\n\"When will Lord Nityananda have mercy upon me so that I can realize the uselessness of material \npleasure?'\nHe is praying in that way. Who is Nityananda? He is Lord Balarama. Nityananda is the same as Lord \nBalarama. He has appeared to serve Lord Caitanya in the same way as Lord Balarama has appeared to \nserve Lord Krsna.\nAnd as Prabhupada says in today's purport, \"Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and \nboth of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take shelter of Their lotus \nfeet.\"\nWhat is their weapon?\nkrsna-varnam tvisakrsnam\nsangopangastra-parsadam\nSB 11.5.32\nThe verse describes how Lord Caitanya appears with His weapons. What is Lord Caitanya's weapon? \nHe's not coming to chop off heads. Not coming with a club to beat and destroy. He's coming with the \nweapon of harinama sankirtan. That is the weapon He has come with in this age of Kali.\n\nSrila Bhaktisiddhanti Sarasvati Thakur describes in one article of the Harmonist Magazine.\n\"Nityananda alone possesses the distinctive function of the guru. In Nityananda the function is \nembodied. Nityananda is the servant-God. He serves Sri Gaurasundara by the distinctive method of \nreverential servitude. He is identical with Sri Balarama of krsna-lila.[...]\n[...]\"But Nityananda does not directly instruct in the confidential service of Krsna. Srimati Radhika is \nthe guru of the inner circle of the servants of Krsna. Srimati Radhika, however, accepts the offer of \nservice of only those souls who are specially favored by Nityananda and are deemed by Him to be fit \nfor Her service.\nSo in all respects we are dependent upon the mercy of Nityananda Balarama to become qualifided to \ndance in the spiritual world and to be fully engaged in loving devotional service to the Lord.\nThis is the goal. Prabhupada clearly states this right from the outset of the verse. The goal is to go back \nhome, back to Godhead. The goal is not to be happy in this material world.\nThe devotee who understands this goal may become happy in this world. But as Rupa Goswami says, \nthere is three types of happiness. 1) Happiness derived from sense gratification, which is temporary. 2) \nHappiness which comes from liberation, which can also be temporary.\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\nOne will fall down from his position of imagined superiority if he hasn't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus \nfeet. And 3) The happiness which comes from bhakti, by realizing\njivera 'svarupa' haya -- krsnera 'nitya-dasa'\nI am Krsna's eternal servant, and my only business in life is to find shelter at His lotus feet. This is real \nhappiness.\nBy the mercy of guru, by the mercy of predecessor gurus, and by the mercy of Lord Balarama. This is \nwhat it means to take shelter. And this is why we observe Lord Balarama's appearance day... to pray for\nthis strength.\nHare Krsna","attachment_name":"balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf","attachment_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/sites/default/files/attachments/balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf"},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"ru":{"title":"26 августа, 2018 - Алматы, Казахстан - Лекция на Баларама Пурниме - Английский/ Русский","event":"Festival","topic":"Шримад Бхагаватам","translation":"Русский","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"","attachment_name":""},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"counters":{"audio_page_view":0,"audio_play_count":0,"downloads":"147","video_page_view":0,"en_transcription_view":0,"ru_transcription_view":0,"en_summary_view":0,"ru_summary_view":0}},{"uuid":"eb9ba9ea-4a8e-4ab5-9a58-03009d5e764e","needs_translation":true,"created_date":"2018-08-11","published_date":"","author":"Niranjana Swami","part":"4","chapter":"30","verse":"10","download_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/download/33333","lecture_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/en/lecture/26394","duration":"01:56:48","downloads":"129","audio_link":"https://nrs-site.s3.amazonaws.com/lectures/2018/2018-08/2018.08.11_e.s.nirandzhana_svami._shb-4.30.10_retrit.magdalinovka-lower_compression.mp3","soundCloud_link":"https://soundcloud.com/niranjana-swami/august-11-2013-disciple","youtube":"","en":{"title":"August 11, 2018 - Disciple Retreat - Magdalinivka - SB 4.30.10 - English/ Russian","event":"Retreat","topic":"Srimad Bhagavatam","translation":"Russian","location":"Magdalinivka","transcription":{"text":"\n\nAugust 11, 2018 – Disciple Retreat in Magdalinivka – SB 4.30.10 \n \nThe following is a partially-edited transcription of a lecture given on August 11, 2018, at the \nDisciple Retreat in Magdalinivka, Ukraine: \n \n \nye tu mam rudra-gitena \nsayam pratah samahitah \nstuvanty aham kama-varan \ndasye prajnam ca sobhanam \n \nTRANSLATION \nThose who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence. \n \nPURPORT \nGood intelligence means going back home, back to Godhead. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita \n(10.10): \n \ntesam satata-yuktanam \nbhajatam priti-purvakam \ndadami buddhi-yogam tam \nyena mam upayanti te \n \n\"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by \nwhich they can come to Me.\" \n \nOne who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know that the highest \nperfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this verse it is \nindicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracetas, the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is \nthe way of the parampara system. If we follow the acaryas, we attain the same benefit as our \npredecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly \nhearing Bhagavad-gita from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no difference \nbetween hearing Bhagavad-gita directly from the Supreme Lord and following a personality like \nArjuna, who formerly heard Bhagavad-gita directly from the Lord. Sometimes foolish people \nargue that since Krsna is not present at the moment, one cannot take direct instructions from \nHim. Such foolish people do not know that there is no difference between directly hearing \nBhagavad-gita and reading it, as long as one accepts Bhagavad-gita as it is, spoken by the Lord. \nHowever, if one wants to understand Bhagavad-gita by his imperfect interpretations, one \ncannot possibly understand the mysteries of Bhagavad-gita, even though one may be a great \n\nscholar according to mundane estimation. \n \nNiranjana Swami: \n \nI'd like to put this verse a little bit into context before we speak about the purport Srila \nPrabhupada gave on the verse.  \n \nThis verse is spoken about the Pracetas, the sons of King Pracinabarhisat. King Pracinabarhisat \nbecame known as a Prajapati entrusted with the responsibility to create progeny. He had ten \nsons. He instructed his sons to prepare for householder life which for them meant to perform \nausterities for 10,000 years.  \n \nWhile traveling west to execute their father's order, they come upon a big lake, so big that it \nlooked like an ocean. They became captivated by the beautiful appearance of this lake. All of a \nsudden, they heard the sounds of drums, kettledrums and other instruments being played. The \nsounds were coming from within the lake. Just then, appearing from within the lake appeared \nLord Siva. Lord Siva came to them because he understood them to be highly qualified persons.  \n \nAn interesting point which I noticed when I was looking at these verses this morning is that Lord \nSiva was also attracted to the Pracetas because they were dedicated to following the order of \ntheir father. Prabhupada said in the purport that because they were surrendered to following \nthat order, Lord Siva saw the Pracetas as highly qualified persons and therefore he wanted to \ngive His association to them.  \n \nI bring this point up because yesterday we were talking about Dhruva Maharaja who was fixed \non the order of his mother. His mother requested him to follow the recommendations of his \nstepmother Suruci... to go to the forest to seek out the Supreme Lord, again, for the fulfillment \nof his desire. That point is made today in this verse also. By offering this prayer given by Lord \nSiva, the Lord told the Pracetas, \"they can both fulfill their desires and attain good intelligence.\" \n \nDhruva Maharaja went to the forest to seek out the Supreme Lord because he also wanted the \nfulfillment of his desires. We didn't speak that much on that point yesterday, but we know what \nhis desires were.  \n \nDhruva Maharaja was insulted and wanted revenge. He wanted to get a kingdom better than \nhis father's, grandfather's and great-grandfather's. He was so fixed on his mother's instructions \nthat when Narada Muni, who saw Dhruva Maharaja as a good candidate just as Lord Siva saw \nthe Pracetas as good candidates, gave Dhruva Maharaja instructions to return home, Dhruva \nMaharaja was more intent on going to the forest to obtain the darshan of the Supreme Lord. He \nhad desires he wanted fulfilled from Him.  \n \nNarada Muni tested Dhruva by instructing him, \"Just become equipoised, be self-satisfied. Do \nnot be disturbed by these things you are feeling in your heart, The forest is no place for a young \nboy like you. You're too young for such austerities. Wait until you are older.\", Dhruva Maharaja \n\nwas nonetheless fixed. \"No I have to seek out the Supreme Lord. I was told by my mother that \nHe can take care of everything for me. Sorry I know those are good instructions, but they don't \ntouch my heart. I've got something else on my mind. \n \nDhruva was fixed. \"I was told by my mother that the Lord will take care of my desires. She told \nme to go to the forest and you're telling me, 'Don't go to the forest.'\"  \n \nNarada Muni, an expert judge of time, place, and circumstances, then adjusted everything. He \nstill saw Dhruva as a good candidate and gave him instructions how he could get his desires \nfulfilled.  \n \nInterestingly, because it's similar to what we are going to hear about the Pracetas, Narada Muni \nalso gave Dhruva Maharaja a mantra to chant. He told him, \"If you chant this mantra you will be \nblessed by the Lord according to your desire.\" Srila Prabhupada explained in one purport in that \nsection about Dhruva Maharaja, that Dhruva Maharaja was initiated in the Visnu-mantra and \nwas given the mantra \"om namo bhagavate vasudevaya.\" \n \nIn the pastime with the Pracetas, the Pracetas had an order from their father. They were strictly \nfollowing his order, Lord Siva appeared to them, saw them as highly qualified persons, and told \nthem that because they were so qualified, he wanted to give them a mantra, or stotra, to \nchant. He told them that by chanting this mantra, \"...you will certainly achieve all your desired \nobjectives without fail.\" SB 4.24.79 \n \nIn connection to this point, I wanted to read a few verses from a previous chapter,  \n \n\"Although rendering devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and worshiping \nHim are very difficult, if one vibrates or simply reads this stotra [prayer] composed and sung by \nme [Lord Siva], he will very easily be able to invoke the mercy of the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead.\" (SB 4.24.76) \n \n\"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the dearmost objective of all auspicious benedictions. \nA human being who sings this song sung by me can please the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead. Such a devotee, being fixed in the Lord's devotional service, can acquire whatever he \nwants from the Supreme Lord. (SB 4.24.77) \n \nIn other words, Lord Siva is telling them, \"You can get whatever you desire to accomplish. \nWorship the Lord and get the fulfillment of your desire.\"  \n \nAnd in today's verse, after gaining darshan of the Lord, the Lord told the Pracetas,  \n \n\"Those who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence.\" (SB 4.30.10 \n \n\nAnd what did Prabhupada say in the purport today? What is good intelligence? Anyone \nremember what Prabhupada said? Yes...to go back to Godhead. That is good intelligence. He \nquotes the verse,  \n \ntesam satata-yuktanam \nbhajatam priti-purvakam \ndadami buddhi-yogam tam \nyena mam upayanti te \n \n\"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by \nwhich they can come to Me.\" (BG 10.10) \n \nThis is good intelligence. One gets the fulfillment of his desires and goes back to Godhead.  \n \nDhruva Maharaja got the fulfillment of his desires. However, in this case, when the Lord \nappeared to Dhruva and revealed all the desires that He would fulfill for him, Dhruva Maharaja \nwas completely distressed.  \n \nSomeone might ask, \"Why was he distressed? He got the fulfillment of his desires.\" But \nVisvanath Cakravarti Thakur explains that Dhruva Maharaja was distressed because the Lord \nfulfilled his previous desires. And after getting the darshan of the Lord, he realized that those \nprevious desires were so paltry, so petty. \n \nWhat were his previous desires? He wanted revenge. He wanted a kingdom. When the Lord \nappeared before Dhruva Maharaja, He told Dhruva Maharaja, \"You will get your father's throne \nand you will rule your father's kingdom for 36,000 years.\" That's what Dhruva wanted. He was \npreviously thinking, \"I couldn't sit on my father's lap. I want to be able to sit on the throne.\" But \nhe wanted something even greater than that. We'll get to that.  \n \nBut the first thing the Lord said was that \"You will rule the kingdom for 36,000 years. You will \nperform sacrifices. But you will remember Me. There will be no obstacles in your service as \nKing. You will remember the goal of your sacrifices.\" \n \nThe Lord detailed how Dhruva will rule his father's kingdom. After that, he will have a kingdom \neven better than Lord Brahma's. He will have his own planet, the polestar within this universe. \nWhen all planets in this universe are destroyed at the time of universal devastation, the \npolestar will remain. So ultimately he would rule a kingdom even better than Lord Brahma's.  \n \nIn addition, the Lord also told Dhruva, \"Your stepbrother will go to the forest to hunt and he will \nbe killed. Your stepmother, when she hears that her son has been killed in the forest, out of \ngreat despair, she will enter into the forest to look for her son and she will be devoured by a \nforest fire.\"  \n \nThese points were spoken directly to Dhruva by the Lord. And then the Lord departed.  \n\n \nAlthough Dhruva got the fulfillment of his desires, he was lamenting. \"What is the value of \nthose desires in relation to what I just experienced in the darshan of the Lord?\"  \n \nAdditionally, when the Lord appeared to Dhruva, Dhruva became so overwhelmed, he offered \nprayers to glorify the Lord. In those prayers which he personally composed, he asked for only \none benediction from the Lord. \"Please let me always be in the association of Your devotees.\" \n \nHowever, the Lord departed without saying anything about his new request. Visvanath \nCakravarti Thakur explains that that was the reason why Dhruva Maharaja was thrown into \nlamentation even though he got the darshan of the Lord. Dhruva realized that, \"The Lord \nfulfilled all of my previous desires, but He didn't respond to what I said when I saw Him.\" \nDhruva was therefore condemning himself, saying, \"I have prayed only for useless things. My \nactivities were exactly like treatment given to a person who is already dead.\" (SB 4.9.34) \n \nAnyway, Dhruva Maharaja received the fulfilment of his desires. After ruling his father's \nkingdom for 36,000 years, when it was time for him to go to his next destination, a flower \nairplane descended from Vaikuntha. Death personified appeared before him. Death personified \nis a very fearful personality to behold. Most living beings do not know how to deal with this \npersonality. But what did Dhruva Maharaja do? He stepped on the head of death personified \nand used his head as a step to get into the flower airplane to go back to Godhead. \n \nIn this connection, Narada Muni gives the analogy how lightning and illumination appear \nsimultaneously. Death is also like that for those who are fully absorbed in thinking of Krsna. This \nis how important it is to be engaged fully in devotional service. In that state of consciousness, \none is prepared to meet death personified. The transition becomes easier for a devotee fully \nengaged in devotional service.  \n \nIn summary, Dhruva Maharaja got the fulfillment of his desires. Because he worshipped the \nLord and faithfully chanted the mantra given to him by Narada Muni, he ultimately went back \nto Godhead. \n \nLord Siva is telling the Pracetas the same thing, \"Chant this prayer I've given to you, be fixed in \ndevotional service, and one can acquire whatever he wants from the Lord.\" \n \nIn an earlier chapter, it is stated,  \n \n\"A devotee who rises early in the morning and with folded hands chants these prayers sung by \nLord Siva and gives facility to others to hear them certainly becomes free from all bondage to \nfruitive activities.\" (SB 4.24.78) \n \n\"My dear sons of the King, the prayers I have recited to you are meant for pleasing the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead, the Supersoul. I advise you to recite these prayers, which are as \neffective as great austerities.\" (SB 4.24.79) \n\n \nThe Pracetas, received and accepted these prayers. They then performed austerities for 10,000 \nyears while meditating on these prayers that were given to them by Lord Siva. \n \nAfter performing their austerities and chanting this prayer, the Lord appeared to the Pracetas. \nThe Lord, being very pleased by their austerities, spoke an often-quoted verse expressing His \npleasure with the Pracetas' austerities.  \n \n\"The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear sons of the King, I am very much pleased \nby the friendly relationships among you. All of you are engaged in one occupation -- devotional \nservice. I am so pleased with your mutual friendship that I wish you all good fortune. Now you \nmay ask a benediction of Me.\" (SB 4.30.8) \n \nThis is the verse where Srila Prabhupada speaks about unity in devotional service in his purport.  \n \n\"The Lord continued: Those who remember you every evening of every day will become \nfriendly with their brothers and with all other living entities. (SB 4.30.9) \n \nThe Pracetas also offered prayers to the Lord. This is proper... to begin with glorification. We \nshould not just ask for the fulfillment of our desires. Neither does a devotee think, \"If I glorify \nthe Lord I'll get a better chance of getting my desire fulfilled.\" A devotee glorifies the Lord \nbecause he has understood the true glories of the Lord, and therefore he glorifies the Lord's \nqualities, His beauty, His characteristics, His dealings with devotees, His opulences, etc..  \n \nIn addition, in their prayers, the Pracetas requested, ...\"we pray that You will be satisfied with \nus. That is our benediction. We do not desire anything other than Your full satisfaction.\" (SB \n4.30.30) \n \nAnd their other request was: \n \n\"Dear Lord, as long as we have to remain within this material world due to our material \ncontamination and wander from one type of body to another and from one planet to another, \nwe pray that we may associate with those who are engaged in discussing Your pastimes. We \npray for this benediction life after life, in different bodily forms and on different planets.\" (SB \n4.30.33) \n \nWhy do we read, again and again, that devotees who are in the presence of the Lord, pray, \"Let \nme have the association of Your devotees?\" There must be a certain special quality of devotees \nthat inspires devotees to ask the Lord, \"Let me be in the association of Your devotees.\" \n \nThe devotee thinks, \"If I could be in the association of devotees who are always glorifying You, \nthen I'm protected. I'll never be able to forget You.\" That is what a devotee wants. Under all \ncircumstances, he wants to be able to remember the Lord. A devotee thinks, \"If I'm in the \nassociation of devotees who are always glorifying You, how can I forget You?\" \n\n \nThere are so many verses which give emphasis to the value of devotee association. \nIn fact it was Narada Muni who said to King Pracinibarhisat, the father of the Pracetas:  \n \n\"My dear King, in the place where pure devotees live, following the rules and regulations and \nthus purely conscious and engaged with great eagerness in hearing and chanting the glories of \nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, in that place if one gets a chance to hear their constant \nflow of nectar, which is exactly like the waves of a river, one will forget the necessities of life -- \nnamely hunger and thirst -- and become immune to all kinds of fear, lamentation and illusion.\" \n(SB 4.29.39–40) \n \nNarada Muni was giving King Pracinabarhisat good instruction. When Narada Muni first visited \nthe king he was trying to get him to give up his attachment to fruitive activities. He told the \nallegorical story of King Puranjana in an attempt to convince him to give up his attachments. \nAfter hearing about Puranjana and then receiving further instruction from Narada Muni, the \nKing achieved liberation and then the story of King Pracinabarhisat was finished. Vidura then \nasked Maitreya, \"Can you go back to the Pracetas? What happened to them? What did they \nachieve?\" \n \nSo as we were explaining before, the Pracetas got the darshan of the Lord. The Lord asked them \nfor a benediction and their only requests were, \"We ask that you be satisfied by our devotional \nservice and that we have the association of devotees.\" \n \nLet us remember, however, that they were performing austerities under the request of their \nfather who told them to prepare for householder life. So they wanted to fulfill the desire of \ntheir father. So what did the Lord tell them? He said that, \"Because you are all united in \ndevotional service, you will all have your own kingdoms.\" \n \nImagine, each of them having their own kingdoms with no quarreling amongst themselves. The \nLord said, \"You will always have friendly relationships with your brothers and friendly \nrelationships towards all living entities.\" And then He told them, \"You will rule those kingdoms \nfor one million years.\" A million years! Of course, it's a million of our years. In celestial years, it \nwould be less. \n \nAs the Lord told Prahlada Maharaja, He similarly told the Pracetas, \"You will always be engaged \nin sacrifice. I'll be satisfied by your sacrifices so that you will not forget the actual goal.\" \n \nSometimes one may think that, \"Once one gets the darshan of the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead one soon goes back to Godhead.\" It's like the happy ending of the story. He gets the \ndarshan of the Lord and then goes back to Godhead. But here we see in the case of Dhruva \nMaharaja, he remained, reigning over his father's kingdom for 36,000 years. With the \nPracetas... they were ruling over their kingdoms for one million years. But they would perform \ntheir duties in this world without forgetting the Lord.  \n \n\nThat is what Prabhupada explained in his purports, that we perform our duties in this world, we \ntake the mantra which has been given to us, we chant that mantra, obtaining the association of \nthe Lord, and then after performing our duties in this world perfectly in Krsna consciousness, \nwe go back to Godhead.  \n \nIt's how we are supposed to live in this world. It's not that we are all just going to chant and \nwait for the Lord to appear to deliver us. No. We must understand how to perform our duties in \nthis world, especially those duties which have been entrusted to us and take the mantra which \nhas been given to us.  \n \nSrila Prabhupada compared the mantra given to the Pracetas by Lord Siva to receiving the Hare \nKrsna mantra. By performing our duties in Krsna consciousness while chanting the Hare Krsna \nmahamantra, at the appropriate time, all perfection will be there.  \n \nThe point that Srila Prabhupada makes in today's purport is that we should follow the decisions \nmade by those persons who received instructions from the Lord. Following their decisions is as \ngood as receiving instructions from the Lord.  \n \nPrabhupada says, \"One who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know \nthat the highest perfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this \nverse it is indicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracetas, the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is \nthe way of the parampara system. If we follow the acaryas, we attain the same benefit as our \npredecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly \nhearing Bhagavad-gita from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. (SB 4.30.10 Purport) \n \nOne follows the decisions of Arjuna. In other words, by having examples to follow we get \nstrength, courage, enthusiasm and determination to continue to execute our duties in this life.  \n \nWe oftentimes quote Sri Bhaktyaloka. We referred to that quote yesterday.  \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur explains: \n \n\"After receiving initiation and instructions from a bona fide guru, a fortunate disciple should \nfollow the path of the previous sadhus. Those who are proud neglect the previous mahajanas \nand create new paths. As a result, they soon proceed on their inauspicious path and ruin \nthemselves. It is said in the Skanda Purana: \n \nsa mrgyah sreyasam hetuh \npanthah santapa-varjitah \nanavapta-sramam purve \nyena santah pratasthire \n \n\n\"One should strictly follow the easy path which the previous mahajanas have accepted. That \npath bestows great auspiciousness and is devoid of all misery.\" (Sri Bhaktyaloka, Chapter 10) \n  \nWe speak on this point a lot. Actually this is the point I was asked to speak on today. I am just \ngetting to it now. But it's all connected. It's connected to Dhruva Maharaja, it's connected to \nthe Pracetas, it's connected to Haridas Thakur about whom Bhaktivinode Thakur speaks. He \nsays that we have to have examples, our mahajanas, from whom we take shelter. We must try \nto remember their activities and to remember their decisions in order to get strength. \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur continues,  \n \n\"By discussing the path of the previous sadhus, one gets determination, courage, and \nsatisfaction. \n \nWho does Bhaktivinode Thakur use as an example? He uses the example of Haridas Thakur. \nHaridas Thakur's path wasn't such an easy path to follow. But Bhaktivinode Thakur says that by \nremembering his path it becomes easy.  \n \nDoes that mean that we have to beaten through twenty-two marketplaces? Do we have to be \nthreatened to be killed? Persecuted? Haridas Thakur was subjected to so much. He was \ndragged to prison and threatened by the Kazi. He was told to give up his convictions and to stop \nchanting the holy names. Haridas Thakur's response was, \"You can cut my body to pieces but I \nwill never give up chanting the holy name of the Lord.\" \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur explains that Haridas Thakur taught by his example three very important \nprinciples to be followed by those who follow in the footsteps of previous sadhus. The first, is \nthat one must always be determined, in all circumstances, that \"Yes. I must be determined to \nexecute my duties in this world while remembering the Lord.  \n \nThe second is to never give up the chanting of Hare Krishna.  \n \nThe third principle is to be compassionate towards all other living beings. \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur says that this is the path given by our previous acaryas which must be \nfollowed. It's the easy path. What makes it the easy path to follow? Austerities for 10,000 years \nunder the water? This is the easy path to follow? To go to the forest to eat berries and dried   \nleaves, to then give up all eating, by living off breath alone? To perform severe austerities \nstanding on one toe? This is the easy path? To be threatened, to be beaten in twenty-two \nmarketplaces until death? This is the easy path I'm supposed to follow? \n \nBy remembering them or by following their decisions, whatever difficulties or obstacles we \nneed to overcome become easier for us to surrender. Without an example it's very difficult to \ndo something on our own. \n \n\nTherefore Bhaktivinode Thakur says that those who are proud create their own paths.  \n \n\"Those who are proud neglect the previous mahajanas and create new paths. As a result, they \nsoon proceed on their inauspicious path and ruin themselves.\" (Sri Bhaktyaloka, Chapter 10) \n \nIn other words, they have no one to follow for spiritual strength.  \n \nWe accept the path established by our mahajanas as our examples to follow. By remembering \nthem, whatever difficulties we have to undergo become easier. In comparison to them, our \nausterities are small. We make ourselves think that they are just so big, so difficult, impossible \nto overcome. \"How can I ever do it? This is too much.\" \n \nBut by remembering those who made good decisions and who showed by their example how \nthey crossed the ocean of material existence and went back home, back to Godhead, we get \nstrength, courage, determination and enthusiasm. It makes it easier. That's how it becomes the \neasy path. \n \nIn this regard, I've been telling devotees recently a very practical story I experienced. It means a \nlot to me. It moves my heart. It's what gave me strength. I'm sure that many have heard this \nstory, but I'll tell it again. I love telling it.  \n \nSarvajna dasa: About Sridhara Maharaja?  \n \nYes Sridhara Maharaja. It's such a perfect example. By remembering Sridhara Maharaja, I got \nstrength. We had a previous friendly relationship with each other before he came to Mayapura \nin 2004. When Sridhara Maharaja came to Mayapura, he understood he would soon be leaving \nthis world. He had two desires he wanted fulfilled before departing. He wanted to go to \nMayapura to take part in the installation of Panca Tattva and he wanted to be with his \ngodbrothers.  \n \nHe expressed those desires when he was told by Canadian doctors that he couldn't receive a \nliver transplant because the cancer had spread too far in his body. From Canada, he met \nIndradyumna Maharaja in London and then the two of them came together to Mayapura.  \n \nSridhara Maharaja liked my kirtans. One time when Sridhara Maharaja was staying in a \ndevotee's flat near Bhaktivedanta Hospital at the same time I was being treated in \nBhaktivedanta Hospital, Sridhara Maharaja called me and asked, \"Maharaja can you come over \nand chant with me?\" He was not terminally ill at that time. But he was having a lot of health \nproblems. He was staying in an apartment trying to recover from an earlier treatment.  \n \nSo as soon as I had an opportunity I went over and visited Maharaja. When I arrived I expressed \nhow happy I was to see him. The first thing he said to me was, \"You see that harmonium over \nthere? Can we chant?\" It was just myself and Sridhara Maharaja. The two of us just sat and had \nkirtan together. \n\n \nAnother time when he was in Bombay, Maharaja asked again if I could come. But I couldn't go \nthat time. I believe he was again staying someplace near the hospital in Bombay but I was in \nPune at the Pune Yatra. From Pune I had to immediately go someplace else. So I asked \nMaharaja to forgive me. I told him I couldn't come that time but next time I would definitely \nmake the time to visit and chant together with him. \n \nThe next time I saw Maharaja was in Mayapura. A large group of devotees assembled to receive \nhim. It was a wonderful reception. There's a little funny story in this connection. When \nMaharaja arrived he had all this red around his mouth. It looked like it was blood. When the \ndevotees saw him they were shocked, but nobody wanted to say anything. They came down \nand sat in the room with Sridhara Maharaja who then said, \"I was eating red candy.\"  \n \nAnyway, when I saw Sridhara Maharaja, I embraced him and I said, \"Sridhara Maharaja I'm just \nso happy to see you.\" One of Maharaja's desires was also to have was kirtan in his room every \nnight. So when I embraced Maharaja I just said, \"Maharaja if you want me, I'm available 24/7.\"    \n \nAs it turned out, Sridhara Maharaja did take part in the abhiseka. There are many pictures of \nhim bathing Lord Caitanya during the Panca Tattva abhiseka. He was so absorbed. After the \ndeities were installed Sridhara Maharaja was more or less restricted to his room. It was then \nwhen he had devotees come to his room every evening for kirtan.  \n \nMaharaja was oftentimes lying during these evening kirtans. He couldn't get up. His body was \nswollen, although he had a way of dismissing these things. Sridhara Maharaja was known as the \n\"Jolly Swami.\" He was happy to be in the association of devotees. Sometimes his stomach \nwould swell up with fluids and the doctors had to come in to remove the fluids from his \nstomach. His brothers and a couple of other devotees were there one time when the doctors \ncame in to do the procedure. Sridhara Maharaja turned to the doctor and said, \"It's a boy.\" \n \nAnyway, Maharaja's room was full of devotees, every night. Sridhara Maharaja, because he was \nlying in bed, would oftentimes dance with his arms because he couldn't get up to sit with the \ndevotees. He would say, \"Forgive me, I can't dance, but I'm dancing with you with my arms.\"  \n \nOne night, after the GBC meetings, I had a terrible headache. I was thinking, \"I don't know if I \ncan go to the kirtan tonight with this bad headache.\" I was of two minds. \"I told Sridhara \nMaharaja that I would be there every night, but maybe tonight is an exception.\" \n \nSo after the meeting, I wrote note to Mayapura dasa, Sridhara Maharaja's secretary. I wrote \nsomething like, \"Mayapura, could you please tell Sridhara Maharaja to forgive me. I'm not \ncoming this evening. I have a terrible headache. I'm going back to my room.\" At that time I was \nstaying in the Vaisnava Academy. I had to walk a bit of a distance from the meetings to the \nacademy. While I was walking to the academy, I started to think of Sridhara Maharaja. \"Wait a \nminute. Sridhara Maharaja is lying in bed with a terminal illness, having kirtan. He's in pain. \nWhat is my headache compared to what he is going through? I have a headache. But Sridhara \n\nMaharaja is dancing with his arms with the devotees in kirtan, and I have a little headache.\" \n \nWhile meditating on that, I started to think, \"Oh I better turn around. I better go back.\" What \nseemed to be very significant became insignificant by meditating on his example. I got strength \nfrom that example. So I went back, directly to Sridhara Maharaja's room. I opened up the door, \nstood in the doorway, and the room was full as it always was. I didn't want to go in because I \ndidn't want to step over any of the devotees. But Sridhara Maharaja looked up and saw me. He \nhad received the message from Mayapura. Maharaja looked at me and said, \"Come here.\" And I \nsaid, \"Maharaja, I don't want to disrupt all of the devotees.\" And Sridhara Maharaja said, \"No. \nCome here.\" And he told the devotees. \"Make room for Niranjana Swami.\" \n \nSo, I had to follow his instructions. He's my superior. I had no idea what was coming next. He \nsat up on the bed and said, \"Sit here.\" I was thinking, \"He is going to ask me to give a lecture?\" I \nhad no idea. So I sat down and I didn't know what's next. I don't remember if there was a kirtan \nat the time but I remember feeling like I was the center of attention. I was thinking, \"What's \nSridhara Maharaja going to do?\" \n \nSridhara Maharaja turns to his servant, Mayapura dasa, and says, \"Mayapura, give me the Tiger \nBalm.\" Do you know what Tiger Balm is? He took the Tiger Balm in his hands and said, \"Look at \nme.\" He took the Tiger Balm and started to massage my forehead with it. He just kept on \nmassaging my forehead. It went on for some time. The devotees resumed the kirtan and he was \njust massaging my forehead.  \n \nMaharaja was thinking of my headache. That's a Vaisnava. How can you not love such a \nVaisnava. Here he was thinking of my headache. Such compassion. Absorbed in the holy name. \nDetermined to be in the association of devotees. This is the path we follow. We don't just have \nto go to Bhagavatam to find examples. We can find so many examples in our lives of devotees \nwho are determined to serve under all circumstances. \n \nAnother example...I was just in Boston. There's a godbrother there of mine whose name is \nMukta Vandya dasa. He's a very simple-hearted devotee. He's always engaged in service. He's \nhad two heart attacks. He had one heart attack when he was living in Gita Nagari. He used to \nsell flowers every day in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which is about an hour away from Gita \nNagari. He was married at the time. He worked very hard selling flowers, but he would use \npractically all of the money he earned for the temple. In fact, he was sleeping in a small tool \nshed filled with tools.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu wasn't thinking about accummulating money for himself. He was just \nthinking about how to accummulate money for Radha Damodara and serve the temple. He \nwould work very hard. He'd work so hard that one day he had a heart attack on his way to \nwork. Krsna arranged that he had the heart attack while driving right close to the home of a \nperson who was his auto mechanic. When his mechanic saw him, he immediately knew what \nwas happening and called the hospital. He then had to be airlifted by a helicopter and was \ntaken to another hospital. They saved him. They put whatever they had to put in him. I believe \n\nit was a stent or something like that to open up the blockage.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu gradually recovered and continued to work. He was working a little bit \neasier though. After some time, he got rid of his home when his wife moved elsewhere. So he \nstayed in the basement of the temple building in a little corner. He kept all of his belongings \nthere. He continued to work every day selling flowers and continued to give his profits to the \ntemple.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu always wore very simple clothing. The van he drove for his flower \nbusiness was not very fancy. Unfortunately he had a second heart attack. By that time I was \nalready telling him. \"Mukta, you've got to slow down. You need to take care of your body. It's \nKrsna's body. It's not your body.\" He's loved by so many devotees. He's just a simple-hearted \ndevotee who always just wants to serve. \n \nNow Mukta Vandya Prabhu lives in the Boston temple. He's careful now not to push himself too \nhard. But he's still ready to do any service that needs to be done. He's just fully engaged in \nservice. If somebody comes to the temple, he preaches to them. He has no formal position. He \nhas a little room on the second floor of the temple. Whenever guests come to the temple, they \nalways go to see Mukta. He's the friend of everybody.  \n \nIf there's nobody to give class, Mukta Vandya will go downstairs to give Bhagavad-gita class. If \nthere's nobody to cook the offering, Mukta Vandya will be the first person to run down and \ncook for Radha Gopivallabha. \n \nThe day before I left Boston, one had to leave for Croatia because his father passed away. There \nwas nobody to buy all of the bhoga for a big feast for a big ceremony the temple was having the \nnext day. I arrived at the temple and came through back door of the temple. Mukta Vandya was \nstanding there by a van full of bhoga. He had gone to purchase all the bhoga for the feast with \nanother devotee who went with him to help to carry all of it. There was nobody to buy it, \nMukta Vandya just went out to do it. \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu always goes and buys flowers for the deities. Everybody who knows him \nat the flower market loves him. Sometimes he's given thousands of dollars worth of flowers for \nfree. He's the friend of everybody. Ajata satru. He just wants to serve. He's careful. He doesn't \npush his body. He knows his limits. \n \nOnce every month for a few days he goes to serve Satsvarupa das Goswami. He took first \ninitiation from Srila Prabhpuada but second initiation from Satsvarupa das Goswami. So he goes \nthere just so that he can have an opportunity to serve.  \n \nI was telling the story the other night about Vaisnava Prema. Who was going to see Vaisnava \nPrema practically every day? Who took care of all of the arrangements for him? It was Mukta \nVandya. It was Mukta Vandya who told me the story which I shared with all of you the other \nday. When I asked Mukta Vandya, \"Is Vaisnava Prema in pain?\" He told me, \"I can't say for sure. \n\nWhen I was there two days ago, he was crying although he appeared to be asleep. He didn't \nknow I was there. He was speaking aloud though and was saying, \"How beautiful Vrndavana is.\" \nSo I don't know if he was crying from the pain or if he was crying because he was seeing the \nbeauty of Vrndavana.  \n \nIt was Mukta Vandya who made all of the arrangements after Vaisnava Prema departed. He \nalso visits another devotees whose name is Dina Dayal. He is currently in a nursing home. He \ngoes and brings him prasadam to him all of the time. Mukta Vandya lives for service.  \n \nWhy should we not meditate on such examples? Those who lives for service. This is good \nintelligence. This is the way to go back to Godhead. The way to go back to Godhead is to be \nabsorbed in service. Those who are absorbed in service are making the best preparation for \ngoing back to Godhead. When we think of them, we get strength, courage, enthusiasm and \nsatisfaction. We should be looking for such examples in our life. And, as Srila Prabhupada says \nin today's purport, which should look at their good decisions. This is parampara. This is what it \nmeans to follow in the footsteps of those who are teaching by their example how to make the \nright decisions to be engaged in devotional service.  \n \nHowever long they may have to live in this world, they'll continue living in this world \nperforming their duties. And to get both the fulfillment of their desires and good intelligence.  \n \nPrabhupada says, \"Good intelligence means to go back home, back to Godhead.\" This is what \nwe can learn from those who serve as examples. We should relish hearing about these \nexamples. These examples bring devotional service to life. It makes it real. It gives us a purpose \nfor living in this world. And it gives us a goal to achieve at the end of this life. \n \nThis is what Srila Prabhupada has instructed in this verse about the Pracetas. \n \nI'll read the verse again and then we will end.  \n \nThose who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence.\" \n \nI'm sorry I went a little bit late, but I hope the message was clear. Hare Krsna. \n \n ","attachment_name":"transcription_sb_4.30.10_english.pdf","attachment_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/sites/default/files/attachments/transcription_sb_4.30.10_english.pdf"},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"ru":{"title":"11 августа, 2018 - Ретрит учеников - Магдалиновка - Ш.Б. 4.30.10 - Английский/ Русский","event":"Retreat","topic":"Шримад Бхагаватам","translation":"Русский","location":"Magdalinivka","transcription":{"text":"","attachment_name":""},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"counters":{"audio_page_view":0,"audio_play_count":0,"downloads":"129","video_page_view":0,"en_transcription_view":0,"ru_transcription_view":0,"en_summary_view":0,"ru_summary_view":0}},{"uuid":"1f8bcffa-5bd8-42c3-b89d-081bfb0e3fe4","needs_translation":true,"created_date":"2018-08-26","published_date":"","author":"Niranjana Swami","part":"7","chapter":"15","verse":"45","download_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/download/33355","lecture_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/en/lecture/26495","duration":"01:37:59","downloads":"147","audio_link":"https://nrs-site.s3.amazonaws.com/lectures/2018/2018-08/niranjana_swami_-_sb_7.15.45_on_balarama-purnima_-c2a0almaty_26-aug-2018.mp3","soundCloud_link":"https://soundcloud.com/niranjana-swami/august-26-2018-almaty","youtube":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsg2S32qsdM?rel=gallery-all&wmode=opaque&autoplay=0"],"en":{"title":"August 26, 2018 - Almaty, Kazakhstan - Balarama Purnima Class - English/ Russian","event":"Festival","topic":"Srimad Bhagavatam","translation":"Russian","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"\n\nTranscription of a Lecture Given on Balarama Purnima, August 26, 2018, in Almaty, Kazakhstan\nThe following is a partially-edited lecture given in Almaty, Kazakhstan on Balarama Purnima, August \n26, 2018\nToday we are observing the appearance of Lord Balarama. I will first speak about, \"Who is Lord \nBalarama?.\" I will then speak on a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam in which Srila Prabhupada speaks \nabout the necessity of getting spiritual strength from Lord Balarama.\nLord Balarama is the first expansion of Lord Krsna called a svamsa expansion. There's very little \ndifference between Krsna and Balarama. They are both the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nSome of the differences are that is Krsna is blackish like the monsoon raincloud and Balarama is white.\nKrsna plays a flute and Balarama plays a buffalo horn. Sometimes Balarama carries a flute but most \noften He carries a buffalo horn in Vrndavana. Balarama sometimes carries a plow and club.\nBalarama manifested in Vrndavana as Krsna's elder brother. He first appeared in the womb of Devaki \nand later, by the arrangement of Yogamaya, He was transferred to the womb on Rohini. In Vrndavana, \nBalarama is known as Rohininandana, the son of Rohini.\nOutside of Vrndavana, Lord Balarama is manifest as Mula-sankarsana. Mula-sankarsana is the first \nexpansion coming from Lord Balarama. When Lord Balarama appeared in Vrndavana in the womb of \nRohini, this Mula-sankarsana became drawn to Him and appeared within Him. This is explained in \nGopal Campu. Just as Krsna never leaves Vrndavana, Balarama never leaves Vrndavana.\nFrom Lord Balarama manifests His plenary expansions beginning with Mula-sankarsana. As Mula-\nsankarsana, Balarama is manifest outside of Vrndavana in Mathura and Dwaraka.\nFrom Balarama also comes all living entities. Even the nitya-siddhas in the spiritual world, all of \nKrsna's devotees who are either in santa rasa, dasya rasa, sakyha rasa or vatsalya rasa are all coming \nfrom Lord Balarama. Vrndavana is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama. In fact, the whole \ndhama is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama.\nSo Balarama serves Krsna by providing all this for Krsna's pleasure in the spiritual world. Those in \nconjugal rasa, the gopis, are expansions coming from Srimati Radharani.\nIn this way, all of Krsna's eternal associates, Krsna parisada, are manifestations coming from either \nLord Balarama or Srimati Radharani in the spiritual world.\nMula-sankarsana further expands as Maha-sankarsana. As Maha-sankarsana He becomes the source of \nall of the living entities who are serving Krsna in Vaikuntha.\nWhen we say, \"From Lord Balarama comes\", it suggests that at one time, within time, the living entities\nmanifested from Lord Balarama. But we should know that being under the influence of material time, \nthese things are difficult to conceive in the material world.\n\nFor instance, Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita to Arjuna, \"Never was there a time when you did not exist, \nnever was there a time when all these kings assembled in the battlefield did not exist, never was there a \ntime when I did not exist, nor in the future will any of us cease to be.\" (BG 2.12)\nSo when we say that the living entities are all emanations or expansions coming from Lord Balarama, \nimmediately we have a tendency to think, \"Oh at some point in time, they manifested.\" However, they \nare all eternally manifest.\nJust as Krsna, as stated in Brahma Samhita, is beginningless. Lord Brahma says that Krsna is advaitam \nacyutam, anadim, ananta-rupam. He is nondual. His body is never subject to decay. He is the \nbeginning. He has no end. He is the source of everything. So beginningless means, never was there a \ntime when He did not exist.\nIn the same way, never was there a time when Lord Balarama did not exist. Never was there a time \nwhen all of Krsna's eternal associates did not exist, and the living entities, the jivas, never was there a \ntime when they did not exist. Krsna's energies are always existing simultaneously along with Krsna.\nJust like this material world goes through cycles. It's manifest, it stays for some time and then \nunmanifest. But this manifestation and unmanifestation is an eternal process without beginning or end.\nIf I give you a little time to think about it— just a little time. Never was there a time when Krsna, \nBalarama, the living entities did not exist. This cannot be understood by the limited mind. As long as \nwe are under the influence of time, it is very difficult to understand that which is existing in eternal \ntime.\nKrsna says \"the spiritual world is unmanifest, infallible, and it is the supreme destination. When one \ngoes there he never has to come back. \"When Krsna says that the spiritual world is unmanifest, does it \nmean that it doesn't exist? No. Never was there a time when it manifested. It's eternal. And Krsna says \nthat when one goes there, he never comes back. Tad dhama paramam mama. \"That is My supreme \nabode.\" (BG 8.21)\nSo, as we said, Balarama is the first expansion coming from Krsna. But when did Balarama expand \nfrom Krsna? And when did Maha-sankarsana, Mula-sankarsana expand from the original Balarama? \nAnd when from the Mula-sankarsana did Maha-sankarsana manifest in order to manifest the Vaikuntha \nplanets and all of Krsna's servants in the Vaikuntha planets who serve Him in His various forms? We \ncannot say when it happened. We only use those terms because we think in those terms. And we won't \nbe able to fully understand until we go beyond the influence of time ourselves. Those who are beyond \nthe influence of time, for them, time is ever-present. Krsna's pastimes and Balarama's pastimes in the \nspiritual world are eternally manifest.\nTime is also manifest in the spiritual world. But there it exists to assist Krsna and Balarama in Their \npastimes. There is no destructive feature of time in the spiritual world.\nEvery morning, Krsna, Balarama, and Their cowherd boyfriends after breakfast and milking the cows, \ngo out to the pastures. During the day when the sun is fully manifest in the sky, They along with the \ncowherd boys take shelter in the caves of Govardhana. As the sun continues to pass, later in the evening\nKrsna and Balarama with Their cowherd boyfriends and the cows, return to Gokula.\n\n2\nIn the spiritual world, time is manifest just to assist Krsna in His pastimes. But there is no destructive \nfeature of time as time destroys everything in the material world.\nKrsna tells Arjuna when He manifested the universal form, \"kalo 'smi loka-ksaya-krt pravrddho\", Time \nI am, the great destroyer of the worlds.\" (BG 11.32)\nSo when Krsna creates this material world, first He creates time. That's how creation takes place. \nOtherwise how could creation take place if there was no time? So when it's time for unmanifested \nmaterial elements to manifest as the external energy, time first appears.\nThen from Maha-sankarsana, as we said, in the spiritual world comes Karanadakasayi Visnu, who is \nalso a manifestation of Lord Balarama. And from Karandakasayi Visnu comes Garbodakasayi Visnu \nwho enters into each universe, which are generated from Karanadakasayi Visnu. And from \nGarbodakasayi Visnu who lies in the Garbodaka Ocean, comes the first created being in the universe, \nLord Brahma.\nThey are all expansions coming from Lord Balarama. Then there is Ksirodakasayi Visnu, who is also \nthe supersoul, manifested in the heart of all living beings. After the manifestation of Ksirodakasayi \nVisnu, comes Sesa who is a manifestation of the Lord who serves the Lord in various ways in this \nworld.\nAnanta-sesa, on each of His hoods, holds material universes. That's spiritual strength. Imagine holding \nunlimited universes on your hoods, and you standing on nothing? Try to conceive. It's inconceivable.\nSo Ananta-sea is holding all the universes on his different hoods but he rests on nothing. He is self-\nsufficient. And He is a manifestation of Lord Balarama.\nThere are two manifestations of Sesa. There's Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods, and \nthen there is the Ananta-sesa who is the bed of Lord Visnu. In the Laghu-bhagavatamrita Rupa \nGoswami explains that the Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods is an avesa avatara of \nLord Balarama. He is saktyavesa. He's an empowered jiva who holds the universe on his heads as \nAnanta-sesa.\nThe other manifestation of Sesa is a plenary expansion of Lord Balarama upon whom Lord Visnu lies.\nAnanta-sesa serves Lord Krsna, just as Lord Balarama is serving Lord Krsna in all of these different \nforms in the matter of creation and maintenance of this cosmic manifestation. Ananta-sesa is also \nmanifest as Krsna's pillow, Krsna's shoes, Krsna's bed, Krsna's sacred thread, Krsna's garments, etc.. In \nthis way, Ananta-sesa is rendering service to Krsna.\nSo Lord Balarama, in His different manifestations, is rendering service to Krsna in unlimited ways. \nEven though Lord Balarama is Krsna Himself, He is always absorbed in the mood of, \"I am Krsna's \nservant.\"\nLord Balarama's service mood towards Krsna is described as sankula, or mixed. He is Krsna's friend. \nKrsna goes out with his cowherd boyfriends. Lord Balarama is going with Him into the pasturing \n\ngrounds. He's Krsna's servant as we already described in various ways how Lord Balarama renders \nservice to Krsna. And He also has a mood of vatsalya, because He is Krsna's older brother.\nIn Vedic culture, ancient culture, the older brother is always worshipped and respected as one's \nsuperior. So Balarama also has this vatsalya mood of protecting Krsna.\nWhen Balarama and Krsna entered into the forest of Dhenukasura, Krsna spoke about Lord Balarama \nas follows:\n\"O greatest of Lords, just see how these trees are bowing their heads at Your lotus feet, which are \nworshipable by the immortal demigods. The trees are offering You their fruits and flowers to eradicate \nthe dark ignorance that has caused their birth as trees.\" (SB 10.15.5)\nSo Krsna is considering Balarama His superior. In the forest of Dhenukasura, Balarama is lying down \nwith His head on the lap of the cowherd boys and Krsna is taking Balarama's lotus feet and is \nmassaging them. So Balarama also serves Krsna in this vatsalya mood and is treated as a superior by \nKrsna. Balarama also serves Krsna in madhurya-rasa. But to do that, He is manifested as Ananga-\nmanjari, the sister of Radharani.\nBalarama is also considered Adi-guru. Adi-guru means the original guru. Just as Krsna treats Balarama \nas a superior, He also treats Him as guru. Balarama is akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda means unlimited. \nIn other words, Balarama is the guru that manifests in unlimited forms to serve as guru. And all gurus \nare understood to be representatives of Lord Balarama, who is the source of spiritual strength.\nPrabhupada explains in Krsna book. \"In the Upanisad it is stated, nayam atma bala-hinena labhyah. The\npurport is that one cannot attain the supreme platform of self-realization without being sufficiently \nfavored by Balarama. Bala does not mean physical strength. No one can attain spiritual perfection by \nphysical strength. One must have the spiritual strength which is infused by Balarama, or Sankarsana. \nAnanta, or Sesa, is the power which sustains all the planets in their different positions. Materially this \nsustaining power is known as the law of gravitation, but actually it is a display of the potency of \nSankarsana. Balarama, or Sankarsana, is spiritual power, or the original spiritual master. Therefore \nLord Nityananda Prabhu, who is also the incarnation of Balarama, is the original spiritual master. And \nthe spiritual master is the representative of Balarama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who \nsupplies spiritual strength. In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is confirmed that the spiritual master is the \nmanifestation of the mercy of Krsna.\" (Krsna Book Ch. 2)\nSo Prabhupada refers to the verse from the Mundaka Upanisad.\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvan\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nThis verse means, \"The Supreme Lord cannot be attained by one who has no spiritual strength, one \nwho is careless or wild, or whose austerites are inappropriate. The Lord appears before a person who \nstrives by the right means to attain Him. Such a person enters the spiritual world.\"\n\nOne requires spiritual strength in order to understand Krsna and to enter the spiritual world. \nPrabhupada says that we are not talking about physical strength. Spiritual strength is the strength to \novercome the influence of the modes of material nature, to cross the ocean of material existence, and to\nbecome qualified to enter into that supreme abode which is unmanifest and infallible.\nWho is the source of spiritual strength? It is Balarama who is akhanda guru tattva. He manifests \nHimself in various forms in order to give strength to the living entities in the material world so they can\nfind the determination, courage, and satisfaction to overcome the stringent laws of material nature and \nto achieve entrance into that eternal abode.\nAs the Mundaka Upanisad says, \"Krsna manifests Himself to that person who strives to achieve Him \nby the right means.\" What is the right means?\nThat is the verse we wanted to read today from Srimad Bhagavatam. This verse speaks about the right \nmeans to cross the ocean of material existence, by getting strength from the spiritual master and \npredecessor spiritual masters.\nHow can we overcome the illusory energy by our own strength? A devotee never thinks, \"I am \nspiritually strong by my own endeavors.\" He knows that whatever spiritual strength he has, has been \ngiven to him because he is taking shelter of spiritual strength.\nJust as one takes shelter of Krsna consciousness,\nkrsna -- surya-sama, maya haya andhakara\nyahan krsna, tahan nahi mayara adhikara\n\"Krsna is compared to sunshine, and maya is compared to darkness. Wherever there is sunshine, there \ncannot be darkness. As soon as one takes to Krsna consciousness, the darkness of illusion (the influence\nof the external energy) will immediately vanish. (Madhya 22.31)\nWherever there is Krsna, there cannot be maya. Wherever there is Krsna consciousness, there cannot be\nthe influence of illusion. But we cannot manifest Krsna before us by our own strength.\nSrimad Bhagavatam states:\nathapi te deva padambuja-dvaya-\nprasada-lesanugrhita eva hi\njanati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno\nna canya eko 'pi ciram vicinvan\nMy Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the \ngreatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years. (SB \n10.14.29)\nUnless one gets that drop of mercy he cannot understand.\n3\nKrsna tells Arjuna,\n\nMy dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before \nyou, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My \nunderstanding. (Bg 11.54)\nTherefore the knowledge and strength to cross over the material existence is coming from Krsna and \nBalarama. Balarama is Adi-guru, the original guru, He is the original source of all spiritual strength. If \none wishes to get spiritual strength, he must take shelter of guru and as this verse we are going to read \ntoday says, our predecessor gurus.\nSo this is the verse and purport that I am going to read in this connection. It's the 7th Canto of Srimad \nBhagavatam, 15th chapter, 45th verse.\nyavan nr-kaya-ratham atma-vasopakalpam\ndhatte garistha-caranarcanaya nisatam\njnanasim acyuta-balo dadhad asta-satruh\nsvananda-tusta upasanta idam vijahyat\nTRANSLATION\nAs long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and paraphernalia, which are \nnot fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, namely his spiritual \nmaster and the spiritual master's predecessors. By their mercy, one can sharpen the sword of \nknowledge, and with the power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's mercy one must then \nconquer the enemies mentioned above. In this way, the devotee should be able to merge into his \nown transcendental bliss, and then he may give up his body and resume his spiritual identity.\nThis verse refers to the enemies mentioned in the previous verse. So in order to more fully understand \nwhat this verse is talking about one should know what these enemies are. And this is the previous verse.\nIn the conditioned stage, one's conceptions of life are sometimes polluted by passion and \nignorance, which are exhibited by attachment, hostility, greed, lamentation, illusion, fear, \nmadness, false prestige, insults, fault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, \nbewilderment, hunger and sleep. All of these are enemies. Sometimes one's conceptions are also \npolluted by goodness. (SB 7.15.43–44)\nIs there anyone who thinks that these enemies that we've listed have all been conquered? I'll read them \none more time.\nAttachment. One by one. Hostility. Greed. Lamentation, illusion, fear, madness, false prestige, insult, \nfault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, bewilderment, hunger, sleep. All of these are \nenemies.\nBy the strength of our own intelligence, to some degree, we may be able to deal with some of these \nenemies. But Prabhupada is going to make the point very clear in the purport that simply by knowledge\nitself one cannot cut away from these enemies.\nKrsna says clearly that the living entities in the material world are struggling very hard with material \nexistence. None of us can say, \"I'm not struggling with these things.\".\n\nOftentimes devotees ask me how to deal with the fact that they are struggling with Krsna \nconsciousness. I say to them, \"You're struggling?! It's good that you're struggling. As soon as you stop \nstruggling you're finished.\" If we're struggling it means that we want to overcome these bad influences. \nThose who don't want to overcome them, think it's natural to be lusty. It's natural to be envious. They \ndon't think they are in illusion because they think illusion is reality.\nWe should therefore struggle to find the spiritual strength to overcome these enemies. That much \nstruggling we have to do. If we don't struggle for that, we'll have to struggle with material nature, \nwhich is very hard on the living entity, and causes so much anxiety.\nPrabhupada says that this material world is kuntha. It is a place of anxiety. It cannot be avoided. \nEverything in this world is temporary and the eternal living entity is going to have to be in anxiety \nabout losing that which he is attached to. So he struggles with this illusory energy.\nA devotee therefore prays. \"Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare/ Hare Rama Hare Rama \nRama Rama Hare Hare.\" He's praying to Krsna. He's praying to Lord Balarama. \"Please give me the \nstrength so that I may be engaged in Krsna's service.\" He's praying to Srimati Radharani. Please engage\nme in Krsna's service. He's looking for strength. This is his struggle.\nSo just as this verse states that \"As long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and\nparaphernalia, which are not fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, \nnamely his spiritual master and the spiritual master's predecessors.\"\nSo let me read the purport. Please take note of the emphasis Srila Prabhupada is making about strength.\nIt's a little bit long. Try to listen carefully.\nIn Bhagavad-gita (4.9) the Lord says:\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\" This is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\nIn other words, this is what it means to accept help from the superiors is to go back home, back to \nGodhead. This is the destination that Krsna wants all living entities to achieve. And Lord Balarama and\nthose in the line of Lord Balarama are meant to give us the strength to go back to the spiritual world.\nThis is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\n... to go back home, back to Godhead.\nIt is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.20.17):\nnr-deham adyam sulabham sudurlabham\nplavam sukalpam guru-karnadharam\n\nmayanukulena nabhasvateritam\npuman bhavabdhim na taret sa atma-ha\nThis human form of body is a most valuable boat, and the spiritual master is the captain, guru-\nkarnadharam, to guide the boat in plying across the ocean of nescience. The instruction of Krsna \nis a favorable breeze. One must use all these facilities to cross over the ocean of nescience. Since \nthe spiritual master is the captain, one must serve the spiritual master very sincerely so that by his\nmercy one will be able to get the mercy of the Supreme Lord.\nA significant word here is acyuta-balah. The spiritual master is certainly very merciful to his \ndisciples, and consequently by satisfying him a devotee gets strength from the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore says, guru-krsna-prasade paya \nbhakti-lata-bija: [Cc. Madhya 19.151] one must first please the spiritual master, and then one \nautomatically pleases Krsna and gets the strength with which to cross the ocean of nescience.\nThis is the point I was making before. Simply knowledge, is insufficient. One can study the Vedas for \nmillions of births, as Lord Brahma says in Brahma Samhita, and still never be able to understand \nKrsna. So it's not simply by knowledge that one can cross the ocean of material existence.\nThe purport continues:\nIf one seriously desires to return home, back to Godhead, one must therefore become strong \nenough by pleasing the spiritual master, for thus one gets the weapon with which to conquer the \nenemy, and one also gets the grace of Krsna. Simply getting the weapon of jnana is insufficient. \nOne must sharpen the weapon by serving the spiritual master and adhering to his instructions. \nThen the candidate will get the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nPrabhupada then gives a nice analogy.\nIn general warfare one must take help from his chariot and horses in order to conquer his enemy, \nand after conquering his enemies he may give up the chariot and its paraphernalia. Similarly, as \nlong as one has a human body, one should fully use it to obtain the highest perfection of life, \nnamely going back home, back to Godhead.\nUsing the human form of life to its full potential.\nkamasya nendriya-pritir\nlabho jiveta yavata\njivasya tattva-jijnasa\nnartho yas ceha karmabhih\nLife's desires should never be directed toward sense gratification. One should desire only a healthy life,\nor self-preservation, since a human being is meant for inquiry about the Absolute Truth. Nothing else \nshould be the goal of one's works. (SB 1.2.10)\nThe perfection of knowledge is certainly to become transcendentally situated (brahma-bhuta [SB \n4.30.20]). As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):\n\nbrahma-bhutah prasannatma\nna socati na kanksati\nsamah sarvesu bhutesu\nmad-bhaktim labhate param\n\"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully \njoyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living \nentities. In that state he attains pure devotional service.\" Simply by cultivating knowledge as the \nimpersonalists do, one cannot get out of the clutches of maya. One must attain the platform of \nbhakti.\nbhaktya mam abhijanati\nyavan yas casmi tattvatah\ntato mam tattvato jnatva\nvisate tad-anantaram\n\"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one \nis in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of \nGod.\" (Bg. 18.55) Unless one has attained the stage of devotional service and the mercy of the \nspiritual master and Krsna, there is a possibility that one may fall down and again accept a \nmaterial body. Therefore Krsna stresses in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\"\nThe word tattvatah, meaning \"in reality,\" is very important. Tato mam tattvato jnatva. Unless one \nunderstands Krsna in truth by the mercy of the spiritual master, one is not free to give up his \nmaterial body.\nIn other words, one has to accept another material body.\n4\nAs it is said, aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah: [SB \n10.2.32] if one neglects to serve the lotus feet of Krsna, one cannot become free from the material\nclutches simply by knowledge. Even if one attains the stage of brahma-padam, merging in \nBrahman, without bhakti he is prone to fall down. One must be very careful in regard to the \ndanger of falling down again into material bondage. The only insurance is to come to the stage of \nbhakti, from which one is sure not to fall. Then one is free from the activities of the material \nworld. In summary, as stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, one must get in touch with a bona fide\nspiritual master coming in the parampara of Krsna consciousness, for by his mercy and \n\ninstructions one is able to get strength from Krsna. Thus one engages in devotional service and \nattains the ultimate goal of life, the lotus feet of Visnu.\nSignificant in this verse are the words jnanasim acyuta-balah. Jnanasim, the sword of knowledge, \nis given by Krsna, and when one serves the guru and Krsna in order to hold the sword of Krsna's \ninstructions, Balarama gives one strength. Balarama is Nityananda. Vrajendra-nandana yei, saci-\nsuta haila sei, balarama ha-ila nitai. This bala -- Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya \nMahaprabhu, and both of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take \nshelter of Their lotus feet. They come especially to deliver the fallen souls of this age, papi tapi \nyata chila, hari-name uddharila. Their weapon is sankirtana, hari-nama. Thus one should accept \nthe sword of knowledge from Krsna and be strong with the mercy of Balarama. We are therefore \nworshiping Krsna-Balarama in Vrndavana. In the Mundaka Upanisad (3.2.4) it is said:\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvams\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nOne cannot attain the goal of life without the mercy of Balarama. Sri Narottama dasa Thakura \ntherefore says, nitaiyera karuna habe, vraje radha-krsna pabe: when one receives the mercy of \nBalarama, Nityananda, one can attain the lotus feet of Radha and Krsna very easily.\nse sambandha nahi yara,   \nbrtha janma gela tara,\nvidya-kule hi karibe tara\nIf one has no connection with Nitai, Balarama, then even though one is a very learned scholar or \njnani or has taken birth in a very respectable family, these assets will not help him. We must \ntherefore conquer the enemies of Krsna consciousness with the strength received from Balarama. \n[end of purport]\nThese enemies are like whips. They are beating us again and again, keeping us in the bodily \nidentification. Imagine living with enemies. We are living with enemies right in our own bodies.\nKrsna described the enemy as lust. When Arjuna asked Krsna, \"What is it Krsna that compels a person \nto act even against his own will?\" Krsna replied that \"It's lust only Arjuna which is later transformed in \nanger, which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world.\" How to conquer this enemy on our own \nstrength?\nThose who try to do it on the strength of their own intelligence,\ntvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\n (SB 10.2.32)\n\n[...]their intelligence is impure. They fall down from their position of imagined superiority because \nthey have no regard for Your lotus feet.\nThey are destined to fall, because they haven't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus feet. They haven't taken \nshelter of Lord Balarama. They haven't taken shelter of bhakti, which manifests through the mercy of \nthe spiritual and the predecessor spiritual masters.\nThe spiritual master must represent the predecessor spiritual masters. Only by representing the \npredecessor spiritual master can one strive to achieve the Lord by the right means.\nThe verse nayam atma bala hinena labhyo clearly states that one has to achieve the Lord by the right \nmeans. One should not be wild or careless. By the right means Krsna reveals Himself and one enters \nthe spiritual world.\n5\nThis is the meaning of akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda guru tattva means that Lord Balarama manifests \nHimself as guru in an unlimited variety of forms. And it is the service of guru to give one the strength \nto cross over the ocean of material existence to enter into the spiritual world.\nSo this is how we worship Lord Balarama on His appearance day. We should know that He is adi-guru. \nHe is the original guru and and all other gurus represent Him. Without His mercy, without taking \nshelter of Him, we will never be able to give up this sense gratification and attachment to the material \nworld.\nAs described in the song Gauranga Bolite Ha'be, Narottama das Thakur is praying.\nara kabe nitai-candera karuna karibe\nsamsara-vasana mora kabe tuccha habe\n\"When will Lord Nityananda have mercy upon me so that I can realize the uselessness of material \npleasure?'\nHe is praying in that way. Who is Nityananda? He is Lord Balarama. Nityananda is the same as Lord \nBalarama. He has appeared to serve Lord Caitanya in the same way as Lord Balarama has appeared to \nserve Lord Krsna.\nAnd as Prabhupada says in today's purport, \"Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and \nboth of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take shelter of Their lotus \nfeet.\"\nWhat is their weapon?\nkrsna-varnam tvisakrsnam\nsangopangastra-parsadam\nSB 11.5.32\nThe verse describes how Lord Caitanya appears with His weapons. What is Lord Caitanya's weapon? \nHe's not coming to chop off heads. Not coming with a club to beat and destroy. He's coming with the \nweapon of harinama sankirtan. That is the weapon He has come with in this age of Kali.\n\nSrila Bhaktisiddhanti Sarasvati Thakur describes in one article of the Harmonist Magazine.\n\"Nityananda alone possesses the distinctive function of the guru. In Nityananda the function is \nembodied. Nityananda is the servant-God. He serves Sri Gaurasundara by the distinctive method of \nreverential servitude. He is identical with Sri Balarama of krsna-lila.[...]\n[...]\"But Nityananda does not directly instruct in the confidential service of Krsna. Srimati Radhika is \nthe guru of the inner circle of the servants of Krsna. Srimati Radhika, however, accepts the offer of \nservice of only those souls who are specially favored by Nityananda and are deemed by Him to be fit \nfor Her service.\nSo in all respects we are dependent upon the mercy of Nityananda Balarama to become qualifided to \ndance in the spiritual world and to be fully engaged in loving devotional service to the Lord.\nThis is the goal. Prabhupada clearly states this right from the outset of the verse. The goal is to go back \nhome, back to Godhead. The goal is not to be happy in this material world.\nThe devotee who understands this goal may become happy in this world. But as Rupa Goswami says, \nthere is three types of happiness. 1) Happiness derived from sense gratification, which is temporary. 2) \nHappiness which comes from liberation, which can also be temporary.\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\nOne will fall down from his position of imagined superiority if he hasn't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus \nfeet. And 3) The happiness which comes from bhakti, by realizing\njivera 'svarupa' haya -- krsnera 'nitya-dasa'\nI am Krsna's eternal servant, and my only business in life is to find shelter at His lotus feet. This is real \nhappiness.\nBy the mercy of guru, by the mercy of predecessor gurus, and by the mercy of Lord Balarama. This is \nwhat it means to take shelter. And this is why we observe Lord Balarama's appearance day... to pray for\nthis strength.\nHare Krsna","attachment_name":"balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf","attachment_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/sites/default/files/attachments/balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf"},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"ru":{"title":"26 августа, 2018 - Алматы, Казахстан - Лекция на Баларама Пурниме - Английский/ Русский","event":"Festival","topic":"Шримад Бхагаватам","translation":"Русский","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"","attachment_name":""},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"counters":{"audio_page_view":0,"audio_play_count":0,"downloads":"147","video_page_view":0,"en_transcription_view":0,"ru_transcription_view":0,"en_summary_view":0,"ru_summary_view":0}},{"uuid":"eb9ba9ea-4a8e-4ab5-9a58-03009d5e764e","needs_translation":true,"created_date":"2018-08-11","published_date":"","author":"Niranjana Swami","part":"4","chapter":"30","verse":"10","download_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/download/33333","lecture_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/en/lecture/26394","duration":"01:56:48","downloads":"129","audio_link":"https://nrs-site.s3.amazonaws.com/lectures/2018/2018-08/2018.08.11_e.s.nirandzhana_svami._shb-4.30.10_retrit.magdalinovka-lower_compression.mp3","soundCloud_link":"https://soundcloud.com/niranjana-swami/august-11-2013-disciple","youtube":"","en":{"title":"August 11, 2018 - Disciple Retreat - Magdalinivka - SB 4.30.10 - English/ Russian","event":"Retreat","topic":"Srimad Bhagavatam","translation":"Russian","location":"Magdalinivka","transcription":{"text":"\n\nAugust 11, 2018 – Disciple Retreat in Magdalinivka – SB 4.30.10 \n \nThe following is a partially-edited transcription of a lecture given on August 11, 2018, at the \nDisciple Retreat in Magdalinivka, Ukraine: \n \n \nye tu mam rudra-gitena \nsayam pratah samahitah \nstuvanty aham kama-varan \ndasye prajnam ca sobhanam \n \nTRANSLATION \nThose who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence. \n \nPURPORT \nGood intelligence means going back home, back to Godhead. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita \n(10.10): \n \ntesam satata-yuktanam \nbhajatam priti-purvakam \ndadami buddhi-yogam tam \nyena mam upayanti te \n \n\"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by \nwhich they can come to Me.\" \n \nOne who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know that the highest \nperfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this verse it is \nindicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracetas, the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is \nthe way of the parampara system. If we follow the acaryas, we attain the same benefit as our \npredecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly \nhearing Bhagavad-gita from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no difference \nbetween hearing Bhagavad-gita directly from the Supreme Lord and following a personality like \nArjuna, who formerly heard Bhagavad-gita directly from the Lord. Sometimes foolish people \nargue that since Krsna is not present at the moment, one cannot take direct instructions from \nHim. Such foolish people do not know that there is no difference between directly hearing \nBhagavad-gita and reading it, as long as one accepts Bhagavad-gita as it is, spoken by the Lord. \nHowever, if one wants to understand Bhagavad-gita by his imperfect interpretations, one \ncannot possibly understand the mysteries of Bhagavad-gita, even though one may be a great \n\nscholar according to mundane estimation. \n \nNiranjana Swami: \n \nI'd like to put this verse a little bit into context before we speak about the purport Srila \nPrabhupada gave on the verse.  \n \nThis verse is spoken about the Pracetas, the sons of King Pracinabarhisat. King Pracinabarhisat \nbecame known as a Prajapati entrusted with the responsibility to create progeny. He had ten \nsons. He instructed his sons to prepare for householder life which for them meant to perform \nausterities for 10,000 years.  \n \nWhile traveling west to execute their father's order, they come upon a big lake, so big that it \nlooked like an ocean. They became captivated by the beautiful appearance of this lake. All of a \nsudden, they heard the sounds of drums, kettledrums and other instruments being played. The \nsounds were coming from within the lake. Just then, appearing from within the lake appeared \nLord Siva. Lord Siva came to them because he understood them to be highly qualified persons.  \n \nAn interesting point which I noticed when I was looking at these verses this morning is that Lord \nSiva was also attracted to the Pracetas because they were dedicated to following the order of \ntheir father. Prabhupada said in the purport that because they were surrendered to following \nthat order, Lord Siva saw the Pracetas as highly qualified persons and therefore he wanted to \ngive His association to them.  \n \nI bring this point up because yesterday we were talking about Dhruva Maharaja who was fixed \non the order of his mother. His mother requested him to follow the recommendations of his \nstepmother Suruci... to go to the forest to seek out the Supreme Lord, again, for the fulfillment \nof his desire. That point is made today in this verse also. By offering this prayer given by Lord \nSiva, the Lord told the Pracetas, \"they can both fulfill their desires and attain good intelligence.\" \n \nDhruva Maharaja went to the forest to seek out the Supreme Lord because he also wanted the \nfulfillment of his desires. We didn't speak that much on that point yesterday, but we know what \nhis desires were.  \n \nDhruva Maharaja was insulted and wanted revenge. He wanted to get a kingdom better than \nhis father's, grandfather's and great-grandfather's. He was so fixed on his mother's instructions \nthat when Narada Muni, who saw Dhruva Maharaja as a good candidate just as Lord Siva saw \nthe Pracetas as good candidates, gave Dhruva Maharaja instructions to return home, Dhruva \nMaharaja was more intent on going to the forest to obtain the darshan of the Supreme Lord. He \nhad desires he wanted fulfilled from Him.  \n \nNarada Muni tested Dhruva by instructing him, \"Just become equipoised, be self-satisfied. Do \nnot be disturbed by these things you are feeling in your heart, The forest is no place for a young \nboy like you. You're too young for such austerities. Wait until you are older.\", Dhruva Maharaja \n\nwas nonetheless fixed. \"No I have to seek out the Supreme Lord. I was told by my mother that \nHe can take care of everything for me. Sorry I know those are good instructions, but they don't \ntouch my heart. I've got something else on my mind. \n \nDhruva was fixed. \"I was told by my mother that the Lord will take care of my desires. She told \nme to go to the forest and you're telling me, 'Don't go to the forest.'\"  \n \nNarada Muni, an expert judge of time, place, and circumstances, then adjusted everything. He \nstill saw Dhruva as a good candidate and gave him instructions how he could get his desires \nfulfilled.  \n \nInterestingly, because it's similar to what we are going to hear about the Pracetas, Narada Muni \nalso gave Dhruva Maharaja a mantra to chant. He told him, \"If you chant this mantra you will be \nblessed by the Lord according to your desire.\" Srila Prabhupada explained in one purport in that \nsection about Dhruva Maharaja, that Dhruva Maharaja was initiated in the Visnu-mantra and \nwas given the mantra \"om namo bhagavate vasudevaya.\" \n \nIn the pastime with the Pracetas, the Pracetas had an order from their father. They were strictly \nfollowing his order, Lord Siva appeared to them, saw them as highly qualified persons, and told \nthem that because they were so qualified, he wanted to give them a mantra, or stotra, to \nchant. He told them that by chanting this mantra, \"...you will certainly achieve all your desired \nobjectives without fail.\" SB 4.24.79 \n \nIn connection to this point, I wanted to read a few verses from a previous chapter,  \n \n\"Although rendering devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and worshiping \nHim are very difficult, if one vibrates or simply reads this stotra [prayer] composed and sung by \nme [Lord Siva], he will very easily be able to invoke the mercy of the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead.\" (SB 4.24.76) \n \n\"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the dearmost objective of all auspicious benedictions. \nA human being who sings this song sung by me can please the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead. Such a devotee, being fixed in the Lord's devotional service, can acquire whatever he \nwants from the Supreme Lord. (SB 4.24.77) \n \nIn other words, Lord Siva is telling them, \"You can get whatever you desire to accomplish. \nWorship the Lord and get the fulfillment of your desire.\"  \n \nAnd in today's verse, after gaining darshan of the Lord, the Lord told the Pracetas,  \n \n\"Those who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence.\" (SB 4.30.10 \n \n\nAnd what did Prabhupada say in the purport today? What is good intelligence? Anyone \nremember what Prabhupada said? Yes...to go back to Godhead. That is good intelligence. He \nquotes the verse,  \n \ntesam satata-yuktanam \nbhajatam priti-purvakam \ndadami buddhi-yogam tam \nyena mam upayanti te \n \n\"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by \nwhich they can come to Me.\" (BG 10.10) \n \nThis is good intelligence. One gets the fulfillment of his desires and goes back to Godhead.  \n \nDhruva Maharaja got the fulfillment of his desires. However, in this case, when the Lord \nappeared to Dhruva and revealed all the desires that He would fulfill for him, Dhruva Maharaja \nwas completely distressed.  \n \nSomeone might ask, \"Why was he distressed? He got the fulfillment of his desires.\" But \nVisvanath Cakravarti Thakur explains that Dhruva Maharaja was distressed because the Lord \nfulfilled his previous desires. And after getting the darshan of the Lord, he realized that those \nprevious desires were so paltry, so petty. \n \nWhat were his previous desires? He wanted revenge. He wanted a kingdom. When the Lord \nappeared before Dhruva Maharaja, He told Dhruva Maharaja, \"You will get your father's throne \nand you will rule your father's kingdom for 36,000 years.\" That's what Dhruva wanted. He was \npreviously thinking, \"I couldn't sit on my father's lap. I want to be able to sit on the throne.\" But \nhe wanted something even greater than that. We'll get to that.  \n \nBut the first thing the Lord said was that \"You will rule the kingdom for 36,000 years. You will \nperform sacrifices. But you will remember Me. There will be no obstacles in your service as \nKing. You will remember the goal of your sacrifices.\" \n \nThe Lord detailed how Dhruva will rule his father's kingdom. After that, he will have a kingdom \neven better than Lord Brahma's. He will have his own planet, the polestar within this universe. \nWhen all planets in this universe are destroyed at the time of universal devastation, the \npolestar will remain. So ultimately he would rule a kingdom even better than Lord Brahma's.  \n \nIn addition, the Lord also told Dhruva, \"Your stepbrother will go to the forest to hunt and he will \nbe killed. Your stepmother, when she hears that her son has been killed in the forest, out of \ngreat despair, she will enter into the forest to look for her son and she will be devoured by a \nforest fire.\"  \n \nThese points were spoken directly to Dhruva by the Lord. And then the Lord departed.  \n\n \nAlthough Dhruva got the fulfillment of his desires, he was lamenting. \"What is the value of \nthose desires in relation to what I just experienced in the darshan of the Lord?\"  \n \nAdditionally, when the Lord appeared to Dhruva, Dhruva became so overwhelmed, he offered \nprayers to glorify the Lord. In those prayers which he personally composed, he asked for only \none benediction from the Lord. \"Please let me always be in the association of Your devotees.\" \n \nHowever, the Lord departed without saying anything about his new request. Visvanath \nCakravarti Thakur explains that that was the reason why Dhruva Maharaja was thrown into \nlamentation even though he got the darshan of the Lord. Dhruva realized that, \"The Lord \nfulfilled all of my previous desires, but He didn't respond to what I said when I saw Him.\" \nDhruva was therefore condemning himself, saying, \"I have prayed only for useless things. My \nactivities were exactly like treatment given to a person who is already dead.\" (SB 4.9.34) \n \nAnyway, Dhruva Maharaja received the fulfilment of his desires. After ruling his father's \nkingdom for 36,000 years, when it was time for him to go to his next destination, a flower \nairplane descended from Vaikuntha. Death personified appeared before him. Death personified \nis a very fearful personality to behold. Most living beings do not know how to deal with this \npersonality. But what did Dhruva Maharaja do? He stepped on the head of death personified \nand used his head as a step to get into the flower airplane to go back to Godhead. \n \nIn this connection, Narada Muni gives the analogy how lightning and illumination appear \nsimultaneously. Death is also like that for those who are fully absorbed in thinking of Krsna. This \nis how important it is to be engaged fully in devotional service. In that state of consciousness, \none is prepared to meet death personified. The transition becomes easier for a devotee fully \nengaged in devotional service.  \n \nIn summary, Dhruva Maharaja got the fulfillment of his desires. Because he worshipped the \nLord and faithfully chanted the mantra given to him by Narada Muni, he ultimately went back \nto Godhead. \n \nLord Siva is telling the Pracetas the same thing, \"Chant this prayer I've given to you, be fixed in \ndevotional service, and one can acquire whatever he wants from the Lord.\" \n \nIn an earlier chapter, it is stated,  \n \n\"A devotee who rises early in the morning and with folded hands chants these prayers sung by \nLord Siva and gives facility to others to hear them certainly becomes free from all bondage to \nfruitive activities.\" (SB 4.24.78) \n \n\"My dear sons of the King, the prayers I have recited to you are meant for pleasing the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead, the Supersoul. I advise you to recite these prayers, which are as \neffective as great austerities.\" (SB 4.24.79) \n\n \nThe Pracetas, received and accepted these prayers. They then performed austerities for 10,000 \nyears while meditating on these prayers that were given to them by Lord Siva. \n \nAfter performing their austerities and chanting this prayer, the Lord appeared to the Pracetas. \nThe Lord, being very pleased by their austerities, spoke an often-quoted verse expressing His \npleasure with the Pracetas' austerities.  \n \n\"The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear sons of the King, I am very much pleased \nby the friendly relationships among you. All of you are engaged in one occupation -- devotional \nservice. I am so pleased with your mutual friendship that I wish you all good fortune. Now you \nmay ask a benediction of Me.\" (SB 4.30.8) \n \nThis is the verse where Srila Prabhupada speaks about unity in devotional service in his purport.  \n \n\"The Lord continued: Those who remember you every evening of every day will become \nfriendly with their brothers and with all other living entities. (SB 4.30.9) \n \nThe Pracetas also offered prayers to the Lord. This is proper... to begin with glorification. We \nshould not just ask for the fulfillment of our desires. Neither does a devotee think, \"If I glorify \nthe Lord I'll get a better chance of getting my desire fulfilled.\" A devotee glorifies the Lord \nbecause he has understood the true glories of the Lord, and therefore he glorifies the Lord's \nqualities, His beauty, His characteristics, His dealings with devotees, His opulences, etc..  \n \nIn addition, in their prayers, the Pracetas requested, ...\"we pray that You will be satisfied with \nus. That is our benediction. We do not desire anything other than Your full satisfaction.\" (SB \n4.30.30) \n \nAnd their other request was: \n \n\"Dear Lord, as long as we have to remain within this material world due to our material \ncontamination and wander from one type of body to another and from one planet to another, \nwe pray that we may associate with those who are engaged in discussing Your pastimes. We \npray for this benediction life after life, in different bodily forms and on different planets.\" (SB \n4.30.33) \n \nWhy do we read, again and again, that devotees who are in the presence of the Lord, pray, \"Let \nme have the association of Your devotees?\" There must be a certain special quality of devotees \nthat inspires devotees to ask the Lord, \"Let me be in the association of Your devotees.\" \n \nThe devotee thinks, \"If I could be in the association of devotees who are always glorifying You, \nthen I'm protected. I'll never be able to forget You.\" That is what a devotee wants. Under all \ncircumstances, he wants to be able to remember the Lord. A devotee thinks, \"If I'm in the \nassociation of devotees who are always glorifying You, how can I forget You?\" \n\n \nThere are so many verses which give emphasis to the value of devotee association. \nIn fact it was Narada Muni who said to King Pracinibarhisat, the father of the Pracetas:  \n \n\"My dear King, in the place where pure devotees live, following the rules and regulations and \nthus purely conscious and engaged with great eagerness in hearing and chanting the glories of \nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, in that place if one gets a chance to hear their constant \nflow of nectar, which is exactly like the waves of a river, one will forget the necessities of life -- \nnamely hunger and thirst -- and become immune to all kinds of fear, lamentation and illusion.\" \n(SB 4.29.39–40) \n \nNarada Muni was giving King Pracinabarhisat good instruction. When Narada Muni first visited \nthe king he was trying to get him to give up his attachment to fruitive activities. He told the \nallegorical story of King Puranjana in an attempt to convince him to give up his attachments. \nAfter hearing about Puranjana and then receiving further instruction from Narada Muni, the \nKing achieved liberation and then the story of King Pracinabarhisat was finished. Vidura then \nasked Maitreya, \"Can you go back to the Pracetas? What happened to them? What did they \nachieve?\" \n \nSo as we were explaining before, the Pracetas got the darshan of the Lord. The Lord asked them \nfor a benediction and their only requests were, \"We ask that you be satisfied by our devotional \nservice and that we have the association of devotees.\" \n \nLet us remember, however, that they were performing austerities under the request of their \nfather who told them to prepare for householder life. So they wanted to fulfill the desire of \ntheir father. So what did the Lord tell them? He said that, \"Because you are all united in \ndevotional service, you will all have your own kingdoms.\" \n \nImagine, each of them having their own kingdoms with no quarreling amongst themselves. The \nLord said, \"You will always have friendly relationships with your brothers and friendly \nrelationships towards all living entities.\" And then He told them, \"You will rule those kingdoms \nfor one million years.\" A million years! Of course, it's a million of our years. In celestial years, it \nwould be less. \n \nAs the Lord told Prahlada Maharaja, He similarly told the Pracetas, \"You will always be engaged \nin sacrifice. I'll be satisfied by your sacrifices so that you will not forget the actual goal.\" \n \nSometimes one may think that, \"Once one gets the darshan of the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead one soon goes back to Godhead.\" It's like the happy ending of the story. He gets the \ndarshan of the Lord and then goes back to Godhead. But here we see in the case of Dhruva \nMaharaja, he remained, reigning over his father's kingdom for 36,000 years. With the \nPracetas... they were ruling over their kingdoms for one million years. But they would perform \ntheir duties in this world without forgetting the Lord.  \n \n\nThat is what Prabhupada explained in his purports, that we perform our duties in this world, we \ntake the mantra which has been given to us, we chant that mantra, obtaining the association of \nthe Lord, and then after performing our duties in this world perfectly in Krsna consciousness, \nwe go back to Godhead.  \n \nIt's how we are supposed to live in this world. It's not that we are all just going to chant and \nwait for the Lord to appear to deliver us. No. We must understand how to perform our duties in \nthis world, especially those duties which have been entrusted to us and take the mantra which \nhas been given to us.  \n \nSrila Prabhupada compared the mantra given to the Pracetas by Lord Siva to receiving the Hare \nKrsna mantra. By performing our duties in Krsna consciousness while chanting the Hare Krsna \nmahamantra, at the appropriate time, all perfection will be there.  \n \nThe point that Srila Prabhupada makes in today's purport is that we should follow the decisions \nmade by those persons who received instructions from the Lord. Following their decisions is as \ngood as receiving instructions from the Lord.  \n \nPrabhupada says, \"One who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know \nthat the highest perfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this \nverse it is indicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracetas, the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is \nthe way of the parampara system. If we follow the acaryas, we attain the same benefit as our \npredecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly \nhearing Bhagavad-gita from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. (SB 4.30.10 Purport) \n \nOne follows the decisions of Arjuna. In other words, by having examples to follow we get \nstrength, courage, enthusiasm and determination to continue to execute our duties in this life.  \n \nWe oftentimes quote Sri Bhaktyaloka. We referred to that quote yesterday.  \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur explains: \n \n\"After receiving initiation and instructions from a bona fide guru, a fortunate disciple should \nfollow the path of the previous sadhus. Those who are proud neglect the previous mahajanas \nand create new paths. As a result, they soon proceed on their inauspicious path and ruin \nthemselves. It is said in the Skanda Purana: \n \nsa mrgyah sreyasam hetuh \npanthah santapa-varjitah \nanavapta-sramam purve \nyena santah pratasthire \n \n\n\"One should strictly follow the easy path which the previous mahajanas have accepted. That \npath bestows great auspiciousness and is devoid of all misery.\" (Sri Bhaktyaloka, Chapter 10) \n  \nWe speak on this point a lot. Actually this is the point I was asked to speak on today. I am just \ngetting to it now. But it's all connected. It's connected to Dhruva Maharaja, it's connected to \nthe Pracetas, it's connected to Haridas Thakur about whom Bhaktivinode Thakur speaks. He \nsays that we have to have examples, our mahajanas, from whom we take shelter. We must try \nto remember their activities and to remember their decisions in order to get strength. \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur continues,  \n \n\"By discussing the path of the previous sadhus, one gets determination, courage, and \nsatisfaction. \n \nWho does Bhaktivinode Thakur use as an example? He uses the example of Haridas Thakur. \nHaridas Thakur's path wasn't such an easy path to follow. But Bhaktivinode Thakur says that by \nremembering his path it becomes easy.  \n \nDoes that mean that we have to beaten through twenty-two marketplaces? Do we have to be \nthreatened to be killed? Persecuted? Haridas Thakur was subjected to so much. He was \ndragged to prison and threatened by the Kazi. He was told to give up his convictions and to stop \nchanting the holy names. Haridas Thakur's response was, \"You can cut my body to pieces but I \nwill never give up chanting the holy name of the Lord.\" \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur explains that Haridas Thakur taught by his example three very important \nprinciples to be followed by those who follow in the footsteps of previous sadhus. The first, is \nthat one must always be determined, in all circumstances, that \"Yes. I must be determined to \nexecute my duties in this world while remembering the Lord.  \n \nThe second is to never give up the chanting of Hare Krishna.  \n \nThe third principle is to be compassionate towards all other living beings. \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur says that this is the path given by our previous acaryas which must be \nfollowed. It's the easy path. What makes it the easy path to follow? Austerities for 10,000 years \nunder the water? This is the easy path to follow? To go to the forest to eat berries and dried   \nleaves, to then give up all eating, by living off breath alone? To perform severe austerities \nstanding on one toe? This is the easy path? To be threatened, to be beaten in twenty-two \nmarketplaces until death? This is the easy path I'm supposed to follow? \n \nBy remembering them or by following their decisions, whatever difficulties or obstacles we \nneed to overcome become easier for us to surrender. Without an example it's very difficult to \ndo something on our own. \n \n\nTherefore Bhaktivinode Thakur says that those who are proud create their own paths.  \n \n\"Those who are proud neglect the previous mahajanas and create new paths. As a result, they \nsoon proceed on their inauspicious path and ruin themselves.\" (Sri Bhaktyaloka, Chapter 10) \n \nIn other words, they have no one to follow for spiritual strength.  \n \nWe accept the path established by our mahajanas as our examples to follow. By remembering \nthem, whatever difficulties we have to undergo become easier. In comparison to them, our \nausterities are small. We make ourselves think that they are just so big, so difficult, impossible \nto overcome. \"How can I ever do it? This is too much.\" \n \nBut by remembering those who made good decisions and who showed by their example how \nthey crossed the ocean of material existence and went back home, back to Godhead, we get \nstrength, courage, determination and enthusiasm. It makes it easier. That's how it becomes the \neasy path. \n \nIn this regard, I've been telling devotees recently a very practical story I experienced. It means a \nlot to me. It moves my heart. It's what gave me strength. I'm sure that many have heard this \nstory, but I'll tell it again. I love telling it.  \n \nSarvajna dasa: About Sridhara Maharaja?  \n \nYes Sridhara Maharaja. It's such a perfect example. By remembering Sridhara Maharaja, I got \nstrength. We had a previous friendly relationship with each other before he came to Mayapura \nin 2004. When Sridhara Maharaja came to Mayapura, he understood he would soon be leaving \nthis world. He had two desires he wanted fulfilled before departing. He wanted to go to \nMayapura to take part in the installation of Panca Tattva and he wanted to be with his \ngodbrothers.  \n \nHe expressed those desires when he was told by Canadian doctors that he couldn't receive a \nliver transplant because the cancer had spread too far in his body. From Canada, he met \nIndradyumna Maharaja in London and then the two of them came together to Mayapura.  \n \nSridhara Maharaja liked my kirtans. One time when Sridhara Maharaja was staying in a \ndevotee's flat near Bhaktivedanta Hospital at the same time I was being treated in \nBhaktivedanta Hospital, Sridhara Maharaja called me and asked, \"Maharaja can you come over \nand chant with me?\" He was not terminally ill at that time. But he was having a lot of health \nproblems. He was staying in an apartment trying to recover from an earlier treatment.  \n \nSo as soon as I had an opportunity I went over and visited Maharaja. When I arrived I expressed \nhow happy I was to see him. The first thing he said to me was, \"You see that harmonium over \nthere? Can we chant?\" It was just myself and Sridhara Maharaja. The two of us just sat and had \nkirtan together. \n\n \nAnother time when he was in Bombay, Maharaja asked again if I could come. But I couldn't go \nthat time. I believe he was again staying someplace near the hospital in Bombay but I was in \nPune at the Pune Yatra. From Pune I had to immediately go someplace else. So I asked \nMaharaja to forgive me. I told him I couldn't come that time but next time I would definitely \nmake the time to visit and chant together with him. \n \nThe next time I saw Maharaja was in Mayapura. A large group of devotees assembled to receive \nhim. It was a wonderful reception. There's a little funny story in this connection. When \nMaharaja arrived he had all this red around his mouth. It looked like it was blood. When the \ndevotees saw him they were shocked, but nobody wanted to say anything. They came down \nand sat in the room with Sridhara Maharaja who then said, \"I was eating red candy.\"  \n \nAnyway, when I saw Sridhara Maharaja, I embraced him and I said, \"Sridhara Maharaja I'm just \nso happy to see you.\" One of Maharaja's desires was also to have was kirtan in his room every \nnight. So when I embraced Maharaja I just said, \"Maharaja if you want me, I'm available 24/7.\"    \n \nAs it turned out, Sridhara Maharaja did take part in the abhiseka. There are many pictures of \nhim bathing Lord Caitanya during the Panca Tattva abhiseka. He was so absorbed. After the \ndeities were installed Sridhara Maharaja was more or less restricted to his room. It was then \nwhen he had devotees come to his room every evening for kirtan.  \n \nMaharaja was oftentimes lying during these evening kirtans. He couldn't get up. His body was \nswollen, although he had a way of dismissing these things. Sridhara Maharaja was known as the \n\"Jolly Swami.\" He was happy to be in the association of devotees. Sometimes his stomach \nwould swell up with fluids and the doctors had to come in to remove the fluids from his \nstomach. His brothers and a couple of other devotees were there one time when the doctors \ncame in to do the procedure. Sridhara Maharaja turned to the doctor and said, \"It's a boy.\" \n \nAnyway, Maharaja's room was full of devotees, every night. Sridhara Maharaja, because he was \nlying in bed, would oftentimes dance with his arms because he couldn't get up to sit with the \ndevotees. He would say, \"Forgive me, I can't dance, but I'm dancing with you with my arms.\"  \n \nOne night, after the GBC meetings, I had a terrible headache. I was thinking, \"I don't know if I \ncan go to the kirtan tonight with this bad headache.\" I was of two minds. \"I told Sridhara \nMaharaja that I would be there every night, but maybe tonight is an exception.\" \n \nSo after the meeting, I wrote note to Mayapura dasa, Sridhara Maharaja's secretary. I wrote \nsomething like, \"Mayapura, could you please tell Sridhara Maharaja to forgive me. I'm not \ncoming this evening. I have a terrible headache. I'm going back to my room.\" At that time I was \nstaying in the Vaisnava Academy. I had to walk a bit of a distance from the meetings to the \nacademy. While I was walking to the academy, I started to think of Sridhara Maharaja. \"Wait a \nminute. Sridhara Maharaja is lying in bed with a terminal illness, having kirtan. He's in pain. \nWhat is my headache compared to what he is going through? I have a headache. But Sridhara \n\nMaharaja is dancing with his arms with the devotees in kirtan, and I have a little headache.\" \n \nWhile meditating on that, I started to think, \"Oh I better turn around. I better go back.\" What \nseemed to be very significant became insignificant by meditating on his example. I got strength \nfrom that example. So I went back, directly to Sridhara Maharaja's room. I opened up the door, \nstood in the doorway, and the room was full as it always was. I didn't want to go in because I \ndidn't want to step over any of the devotees. But Sridhara Maharaja looked up and saw me. He \nhad received the message from Mayapura. Maharaja looked at me and said, \"Come here.\" And I \nsaid, \"Maharaja, I don't want to disrupt all of the devotees.\" And Sridhara Maharaja said, \"No. \nCome here.\" And he told the devotees. \"Make room for Niranjana Swami.\" \n \nSo, I had to follow his instructions. He's my superior. I had no idea what was coming next. He \nsat up on the bed and said, \"Sit here.\" I was thinking, \"He is going to ask me to give a lecture?\" I \nhad no idea. So I sat down and I didn't know what's next. I don't remember if there was a kirtan \nat the time but I remember feeling like I was the center of attention. I was thinking, \"What's \nSridhara Maharaja going to do?\" \n \nSridhara Maharaja turns to his servant, Mayapura dasa, and says, \"Mayapura, give me the Tiger \nBalm.\" Do you know what Tiger Balm is? He took the Tiger Balm in his hands and said, \"Look at \nme.\" He took the Tiger Balm and started to massage my forehead with it. He just kept on \nmassaging my forehead. It went on for some time. The devotees resumed the kirtan and he was \njust massaging my forehead.  \n \nMaharaja was thinking of my headache. That's a Vaisnava. How can you not love such a \nVaisnava. Here he was thinking of my headache. Such compassion. Absorbed in the holy name. \nDetermined to be in the association of devotees. This is the path we follow. We don't just have \nto go to Bhagavatam to find examples. We can find so many examples in our lives of devotees \nwho are determined to serve under all circumstances. \n \nAnother example...I was just in Boston. There's a godbrother there of mine whose name is \nMukta Vandya dasa. He's a very simple-hearted devotee. He's always engaged in service. He's \nhad two heart attacks. He had one heart attack when he was living in Gita Nagari. He used to \nsell flowers every day in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which is about an hour away from Gita \nNagari. He was married at the time. He worked very hard selling flowers, but he would use \npractically all of the money he earned for the temple. In fact, he was sleeping in a small tool \nshed filled with tools.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu wasn't thinking about accummulating money for himself. He was just \nthinking about how to accummulate money for Radha Damodara and serve the temple. He \nwould work very hard. He'd work so hard that one day he had a heart attack on his way to \nwork. Krsna arranged that he had the heart attack while driving right close to the home of a \nperson who was his auto mechanic. When his mechanic saw him, he immediately knew what \nwas happening and called the hospital. He then had to be airlifted by a helicopter and was \ntaken to another hospital. They saved him. They put whatever they had to put in him. I believe \n\nit was a stent or something like that to open up the blockage.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu gradually recovered and continued to work. He was working a little bit \neasier though. After some time, he got rid of his home when his wife moved elsewhere. So he \nstayed in the basement of the temple building in a little corner. He kept all of his belongings \nthere. He continued to work every day selling flowers and continued to give his profits to the \ntemple.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu always wore very simple clothing. The van he drove for his flower \nbusiness was not very fancy. Unfortunately he had a second heart attack. By that time I was \nalready telling him. \"Mukta, you've got to slow down. You need to take care of your body. It's \nKrsna's body. It's not your body.\" He's loved by so many devotees. He's just a simple-hearted \ndevotee who always just wants to serve. \n \nNow Mukta Vandya Prabhu lives in the Boston temple. He's careful now not to push himself too \nhard. But he's still ready to do any service that needs to be done. He's just fully engaged in \nservice. If somebody comes to the temple, he preaches to them. He has no formal position. He \nhas a little room on the second floor of the temple. Whenever guests come to the temple, they \nalways go to see Mukta. He's the friend of everybody.  \n \nIf there's nobody to give class, Mukta Vandya will go downstairs to give Bhagavad-gita class. If \nthere's nobody to cook the offering, Mukta Vandya will be the first person to run down and \ncook for Radha Gopivallabha. \n \nThe day before I left Boston, one had to leave for Croatia because his father passed away. There \nwas nobody to buy all of the bhoga for a big feast for a big ceremony the temple was having the \nnext day. I arrived at the temple and came through back door of the temple. Mukta Vandya was \nstanding there by a van full of bhoga. He had gone to purchase all the bhoga for the feast with \nanother devotee who went with him to help to carry all of it. There was nobody to buy it, \nMukta Vandya just went out to do it. \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu always goes and buys flowers for the deities. Everybody who knows him \nat the flower market loves him. Sometimes he's given thousands of dollars worth of flowers for \nfree. He's the friend of everybody. Ajata satru. He just wants to serve. He's careful. He doesn't \npush his body. He knows his limits. \n \nOnce every month for a few days he goes to serve Satsvarupa das Goswami. He took first \ninitiation from Srila Prabhpuada but second initiation from Satsvarupa das Goswami. So he goes \nthere just so that he can have an opportunity to serve.  \n \nI was telling the story the other night about Vaisnava Prema. Who was going to see Vaisnava \nPrema practically every day? Who took care of all of the arrangements for him? It was Mukta \nVandya. It was Mukta Vandya who told me the story which I shared with all of you the other \nday. When I asked Mukta Vandya, \"Is Vaisnava Prema in pain?\" He told me, \"I can't say for sure. \n\nWhen I was there two days ago, he was crying although he appeared to be asleep. He didn't \nknow I was there. He was speaking aloud though and was saying, \"How beautiful Vrndavana is.\" \nSo I don't know if he was crying from the pain or if he was crying because he was seeing the \nbeauty of Vrndavana.  \n \nIt was Mukta Vandya who made all of the arrangements after Vaisnava Prema departed. He \nalso visits another devotees whose name is Dina Dayal. He is currently in a nursing home. He \ngoes and brings him prasadam to him all of the time. Mukta Vandya lives for service.  \n \nWhy should we not meditate on such examples? Those who lives for service. This is good \nintelligence. This is the way to go back to Godhead. The way to go back to Godhead is to be \nabsorbed in service. Those who are absorbed in service are making the best preparation for \ngoing back to Godhead. When we think of them, we get strength, courage, enthusiasm and \nsatisfaction. We should be looking for such examples in our life. And, as Srila Prabhupada says \nin today's purport, which should look at their good decisions. This is parampara. This is what it \nmeans to follow in the footsteps of those who are teaching by their example how to make the \nright decisions to be engaged in devotional service.  \n \nHowever long they may have to live in this world, they'll continue living in this world \nperforming their duties. And to get both the fulfillment of their desires and good intelligence.  \n \nPrabhupada says, \"Good intelligence means to go back home, back to Godhead.\" This is what \nwe can learn from those who serve as examples. We should relish hearing about these \nexamples. These examples bring devotional service to life. It makes it real. It gives us a purpose \nfor living in this world. And it gives us a goal to achieve at the end of this life. \n \nThis is what Srila Prabhupada has instructed in this verse about the Pracetas. \n \nI'll read the verse again and then we will end.  \n \nThose who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence.\" \n \nI'm sorry I went a little bit late, but I hope the message was clear. Hare Krsna. \n \n ","attachment_name":"transcription_sb_4.30.10_english.pdf","attachment_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/sites/default/files/attachments/transcription_sb_4.30.10_english.pdf"},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"ru":{"title":"11 августа, 2018 - Ретрит учеников - Магдалиновка - Ш.Б. 4.30.10 - Английский/ Русский","event":"Retreat","topic":"Шримад Бхагаватам","translation":"Русский","location":"Magdalinivka","transcription":{"text":"","attachment_name":""},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"counters":{"audio_page_view":0,"audio_play_count":0,"downloads":"129","video_page_view":0,"en_transcription_view":0,"ru_transcription_view":0,"en_summary_view":0,"ru_summary_view":0}},{"uuid":"1f8bcffa-5bd8-42c3-b89d-081bfb0e3fe4","needs_translation":true,"created_date":"2018-08-26","published_date":"","author":"Niranjana Swami","part":"7","chapter":"15","verse":"45","download_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/download/33355","lecture_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/en/lecture/26495","duration":"01:37:59","downloads":"147","audio_link":"https://nrs-site.s3.amazonaws.com/lectures/2018/2018-08/niranjana_swami_-_sb_7.15.45_on_balarama-purnima_-c2a0almaty_26-aug-2018.mp3","soundCloud_link":"https://soundcloud.com/niranjana-swami/august-26-2018-almaty","youtube":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsg2S32qsdM?rel=gallery-all&wmode=opaque&autoplay=0"],"en":{"title":"August 26, 2018 - Almaty, Kazakhstan - Balarama Purnima Class - English/ Russian","event":"Festival","topic":"Srimad Bhagavatam","translation":"Russian","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"\n\nTranscription of a Lecture Given on Balarama Purnima, August 26, 2018, in Almaty, Kazakhstan\nThe following is a partially-edited lecture given in Almaty, Kazakhstan on Balarama Purnima, August \n26, 2018\nToday we are observing the appearance of Lord Balarama. I will first speak about, \"Who is Lord \nBalarama?.\" I will then speak on a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam in which Srila Prabhupada speaks \nabout the necessity of getting spiritual strength from Lord Balarama.\nLord Balarama is the first expansion of Lord Krsna called a svamsa expansion. There's very little \ndifference between Krsna and Balarama. They are both the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nSome of the differences are that is Krsna is blackish like the monsoon raincloud and Balarama is white.\nKrsna plays a flute and Balarama plays a buffalo horn. Sometimes Balarama carries a flute but most \noften He carries a buffalo horn in Vrndavana. Balarama sometimes carries a plow and club.\nBalarama manifested in Vrndavana as Krsna's elder brother. He first appeared in the womb of Devaki \nand later, by the arrangement of Yogamaya, He was transferred to the womb on Rohini. In Vrndavana, \nBalarama is known as Rohininandana, the son of Rohini.\nOutside of Vrndavana, Lord Balarama is manifest as Mula-sankarsana. Mula-sankarsana is the first \nexpansion coming from Lord Balarama. When Lord Balarama appeared in Vrndavana in the womb of \nRohini, this Mula-sankarsana became drawn to Him and appeared within Him. This is explained in \nGopal Campu. Just as Krsna never leaves Vrndavana, Balarama never leaves Vrndavana.\nFrom Lord Balarama manifests His plenary expansions beginning with Mula-sankarsana. As Mula-\nsankarsana, Balarama is manifest outside of Vrndavana in Mathura and Dwaraka.\nFrom Balarama also comes all living entities. Even the nitya-siddhas in the spiritual world, all of \nKrsna's devotees who are either in santa rasa, dasya rasa, sakyha rasa or vatsalya rasa are all coming \nfrom Lord Balarama. Vrndavana is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama. In fact, the whole \ndhama is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama.\nSo Balarama serves Krsna by providing all this for Krsna's pleasure in the spiritual world. Those in \nconjugal rasa, the gopis, are expansions coming from Srimati Radharani.\nIn this way, all of Krsna's eternal associates, Krsna parisada, are manifestations coming from either \nLord Balarama or Srimati Radharani in the spiritual world.\nMula-sankarsana further expands as Maha-sankarsana. As Maha-sankarsana He becomes the source of \nall of the living entities who are serving Krsna in Vaikuntha.\nWhen we say, \"From Lord Balarama comes\", it suggests that at one time, within time, the living entities\nmanifested from Lord Balarama. But we should know that being under the influence of material time, \nthese things are difficult to conceive in the material world.\n\nFor instance, Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita to Arjuna, \"Never was there a time when you did not exist, \nnever was there a time when all these kings assembled in the battlefield did not exist, never was there a \ntime when I did not exist, nor in the future will any of us cease to be.\" (BG 2.12)\nSo when we say that the living entities are all emanations or expansions coming from Lord Balarama, \nimmediately we have a tendency to think, \"Oh at some point in time, they manifested.\" However, they \nare all eternally manifest.\nJust as Krsna, as stated in Brahma Samhita, is beginningless. Lord Brahma says that Krsna is advaitam \nacyutam, anadim, ananta-rupam. He is nondual. His body is never subject to decay. He is the \nbeginning. He has no end. He is the source of everything. So beginningless means, never was there a \ntime when He did not exist.\nIn the same way, never was there a time when Lord Balarama did not exist. Never was there a time \nwhen all of Krsna's eternal associates did not exist, and the living entities, the jivas, never was there a \ntime when they did not exist. Krsna's energies are always existing simultaneously along with Krsna.\nJust like this material world goes through cycles. It's manifest, it stays for some time and then \nunmanifest. But this manifestation and unmanifestation is an eternal process without beginning or end.\nIf I give you a little time to think about it— just a little time. Never was there a time when Krsna, \nBalarama, the living entities did not exist. This cannot be understood by the limited mind. As long as \nwe are under the influence of time, it is very difficult to understand that which is existing in eternal \ntime.\nKrsna says \"the spiritual world is unmanifest, infallible, and it is the supreme destination. When one \ngoes there he never has to come back. \"When Krsna says that the spiritual world is unmanifest, does it \nmean that it doesn't exist? No. Never was there a time when it manifested. It's eternal. And Krsna says \nthat when one goes there, he never comes back. Tad dhama paramam mama. \"That is My supreme \nabode.\" (BG 8.21)\nSo, as we said, Balarama is the first expansion coming from Krsna. But when did Balarama expand \nfrom Krsna? And when did Maha-sankarsana, Mula-sankarsana expand from the original Balarama? \nAnd when from the Mula-sankarsana did Maha-sankarsana manifest in order to manifest the Vaikuntha \nplanets and all of Krsna's servants in the Vaikuntha planets who serve Him in His various forms? We \ncannot say when it happened. We only use those terms because we think in those terms. And we won't \nbe able to fully understand until we go beyond the influence of time ourselves. Those who are beyond \nthe influence of time, for them, time is ever-present. Krsna's pastimes and Balarama's pastimes in the \nspiritual world are eternally manifest.\nTime is also manifest in the spiritual world. But there it exists to assist Krsna and Balarama in Their \npastimes. There is no destructive feature of time in the spiritual world.\nEvery morning, Krsna, Balarama, and Their cowherd boyfriends after breakfast and milking the cows, \ngo out to the pastures. During the day when the sun is fully manifest in the sky, They along with the \ncowherd boys take shelter in the caves of Govardhana. As the sun continues to pass, later in the evening\nKrsna and Balarama with Their cowherd boyfriends and the cows, return to Gokula.\n\n2\nIn the spiritual world, time is manifest just to assist Krsna in His pastimes. But there is no destructive \nfeature of time as time destroys everything in the material world.\nKrsna tells Arjuna when He manifested the universal form, \"kalo 'smi loka-ksaya-krt pravrddho\", Time \nI am, the great destroyer of the worlds.\" (BG 11.32)\nSo when Krsna creates this material world, first He creates time. That's how creation takes place. \nOtherwise how could creation take place if there was no time? So when it's time for unmanifested \nmaterial elements to manifest as the external energy, time first appears.\nThen from Maha-sankarsana, as we said, in the spiritual world comes Karanadakasayi Visnu, who is \nalso a manifestation of Lord Balarama. And from Karandakasayi Visnu comes Garbodakasayi Visnu \nwho enters into each universe, which are generated from Karanadakasayi Visnu. And from \nGarbodakasayi Visnu who lies in the Garbodaka Ocean, comes the first created being in the universe, \nLord Brahma.\nThey are all expansions coming from Lord Balarama. Then there is Ksirodakasayi Visnu, who is also \nthe supersoul, manifested in the heart of all living beings. After the manifestation of Ksirodakasayi \nVisnu, comes Sesa who is a manifestation of the Lord who serves the Lord in various ways in this \nworld.\nAnanta-sesa, on each of His hoods, holds material universes. That's spiritual strength. Imagine holding \nunlimited universes on your hoods, and you standing on nothing? Try to conceive. It's inconceivable.\nSo Ananta-sea is holding all the universes on his different hoods but he rests on nothing. He is self-\nsufficient. And He is a manifestation of Lord Balarama.\nThere are two manifestations of Sesa. There's Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods, and \nthen there is the Ananta-sesa who is the bed of Lord Visnu. In the Laghu-bhagavatamrita Rupa \nGoswami explains that the Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods is an avesa avatara of \nLord Balarama. He is saktyavesa. He's an empowered jiva who holds the universe on his heads as \nAnanta-sesa.\nThe other manifestation of Sesa is a plenary expansion of Lord Balarama upon whom Lord Visnu lies.\nAnanta-sesa serves Lord Krsna, just as Lord Balarama is serving Lord Krsna in all of these different \nforms in the matter of creation and maintenance of this cosmic manifestation. Ananta-sesa is also \nmanifest as Krsna's pillow, Krsna's shoes, Krsna's bed, Krsna's sacred thread, Krsna's garments, etc.. In \nthis way, Ananta-sesa is rendering service to Krsna.\nSo Lord Balarama, in His different manifestations, is rendering service to Krsna in unlimited ways. \nEven though Lord Balarama is Krsna Himself, He is always absorbed in the mood of, \"I am Krsna's \nservant.\"\nLord Balarama's service mood towards Krsna is described as sankula, or mixed. He is Krsna's friend. \nKrsna goes out with his cowherd boyfriends. Lord Balarama is going with Him into the pasturing \n\ngrounds. He's Krsna's servant as we already described in various ways how Lord Balarama renders \nservice to Krsna. And He also has a mood of vatsalya, because He is Krsna's older brother.\nIn Vedic culture, ancient culture, the older brother is always worshipped and respected as one's \nsuperior. So Balarama also has this vatsalya mood of protecting Krsna.\nWhen Balarama and Krsna entered into the forest of Dhenukasura, Krsna spoke about Lord Balarama \nas follows:\n\"O greatest of Lords, just see how these trees are bowing their heads at Your lotus feet, which are \nworshipable by the immortal demigods. The trees are offering You their fruits and flowers to eradicate \nthe dark ignorance that has caused their birth as trees.\" (SB 10.15.5)\nSo Krsna is considering Balarama His superior. In the forest of Dhenukasura, Balarama is lying down \nwith His head on the lap of the cowherd boys and Krsna is taking Balarama's lotus feet and is \nmassaging them. So Balarama also serves Krsna in this vatsalya mood and is treated as a superior by \nKrsna. Balarama also serves Krsna in madhurya-rasa. But to do that, He is manifested as Ananga-\nmanjari, the sister of Radharani.\nBalarama is also considered Adi-guru. Adi-guru means the original guru. Just as Krsna treats Balarama \nas a superior, He also treats Him as guru. Balarama is akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda means unlimited. \nIn other words, Balarama is the guru that manifests in unlimited forms to serve as guru. And all gurus \nare understood to be representatives of Lord Balarama, who is the source of spiritual strength.\nPrabhupada explains in Krsna book. \"In the Upanisad it is stated, nayam atma bala-hinena labhyah. The\npurport is that one cannot attain the supreme platform of self-realization without being sufficiently \nfavored by Balarama. Bala does not mean physical strength. No one can attain spiritual perfection by \nphysical strength. One must have the spiritual strength which is infused by Balarama, or Sankarsana. \nAnanta, or Sesa, is the power which sustains all the planets in their different positions. Materially this \nsustaining power is known as the law of gravitation, but actually it is a display of the potency of \nSankarsana. Balarama, or Sankarsana, is spiritual power, or the original spiritual master. Therefore \nLord Nityananda Prabhu, who is also the incarnation of Balarama, is the original spiritual master. And \nthe spiritual master is the representative of Balarama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who \nsupplies spiritual strength. In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is confirmed that the spiritual master is the \nmanifestation of the mercy of Krsna.\" (Krsna Book Ch. 2)\nSo Prabhupada refers to the verse from the Mundaka Upanisad.\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvan\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nThis verse means, \"The Supreme Lord cannot be attained by one who has no spiritual strength, one \nwho is careless or wild, or whose austerites are inappropriate. The Lord appears before a person who \nstrives by the right means to attain Him. Such a person enters the spiritual world.\"\n\nOne requires spiritual strength in order to understand Krsna and to enter the spiritual world. \nPrabhupada says that we are not talking about physical strength. Spiritual strength is the strength to \novercome the influence of the modes of material nature, to cross the ocean of material existence, and to\nbecome qualified to enter into that supreme abode which is unmanifest and infallible.\nWho is the source of spiritual strength? It is Balarama who is akhanda guru tattva. He manifests \nHimself in various forms in order to give strength to the living entities in the material world so they can\nfind the determination, courage, and satisfaction to overcome the stringent laws of material nature and \nto achieve entrance into that eternal abode.\nAs the Mundaka Upanisad says, \"Krsna manifests Himself to that person who strives to achieve Him \nby the right means.\" What is the right means?\nThat is the verse we wanted to read today from Srimad Bhagavatam. This verse speaks about the right \nmeans to cross the ocean of material existence, by getting strength from the spiritual master and \npredecessor spiritual masters.\nHow can we overcome the illusory energy by our own strength? A devotee never thinks, \"I am \nspiritually strong by my own endeavors.\" He knows that whatever spiritual strength he has, has been \ngiven to him because he is taking shelter of spiritual strength.\nJust as one takes shelter of Krsna consciousness,\nkrsna -- surya-sama, maya haya andhakara\nyahan krsna, tahan nahi mayara adhikara\n\"Krsna is compared to sunshine, and maya is compared to darkness. Wherever there is sunshine, there \ncannot be darkness. As soon as one takes to Krsna consciousness, the darkness of illusion (the influence\nof the external energy) will immediately vanish. (Madhya 22.31)\nWherever there is Krsna, there cannot be maya. Wherever there is Krsna consciousness, there cannot be\nthe influence of illusion. But we cannot manifest Krsna before us by our own strength.\nSrimad Bhagavatam states:\nathapi te deva padambuja-dvaya-\nprasada-lesanugrhita eva hi\njanati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno\nna canya eko 'pi ciram vicinvan\nMy Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the \ngreatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years. (SB \n10.14.29)\nUnless one gets that drop of mercy he cannot understand.\n3\nKrsna tells Arjuna,\n\nMy dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before \nyou, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My \nunderstanding. (Bg 11.54)\nTherefore the knowledge and strength to cross over the material existence is coming from Krsna and \nBalarama. Balarama is Adi-guru, the original guru, He is the original source of all spiritual strength. If \none wishes to get spiritual strength, he must take shelter of guru and as this verse we are going to read \ntoday says, our predecessor gurus.\nSo this is the verse and purport that I am going to read in this connection. It's the 7th Canto of Srimad \nBhagavatam, 15th chapter, 45th verse.\nyavan nr-kaya-ratham atma-vasopakalpam\ndhatte garistha-caranarcanaya nisatam\njnanasim acyuta-balo dadhad asta-satruh\nsvananda-tusta upasanta idam vijahyat\nTRANSLATION\nAs long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and paraphernalia, which are \nnot fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, namely his spiritual \nmaster and the spiritual master's predecessors. By their mercy, one can sharpen the sword of \nknowledge, and with the power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's mercy one must then \nconquer the enemies mentioned above. In this way, the devotee should be able to merge into his \nown transcendental bliss, and then he may give up his body and resume his spiritual identity.\nThis verse refers to the enemies mentioned in the previous verse. So in order to more fully understand \nwhat this verse is talking about one should know what these enemies are. And this is the previous verse.\nIn the conditioned stage, one's conceptions of life are sometimes polluted by passion and \nignorance, which are exhibited by attachment, hostility, greed, lamentation, illusion, fear, \nmadness, false prestige, insults, fault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, \nbewilderment, hunger and sleep. All of these are enemies. Sometimes one's conceptions are also \npolluted by goodness. (SB 7.15.43–44)\nIs there anyone who thinks that these enemies that we've listed have all been conquered? I'll read them \none more time.\nAttachment. One by one. Hostility. Greed. Lamentation, illusion, fear, madness, false prestige, insult, \nfault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, bewilderment, hunger, sleep. All of these are \nenemies.\nBy the strength of our own intelligence, to some degree, we may be able to deal with some of these \nenemies. But Prabhupada is going to make the point very clear in the purport that simply by knowledge\nitself one cannot cut away from these enemies.\nKrsna says clearly that the living entities in the material world are struggling very hard with material \nexistence. None of us can say, \"I'm not struggling with these things.\".\n\nOftentimes devotees ask me how to deal with the fact that they are struggling with Krsna \nconsciousness. I say to them, \"You're struggling?! It's good that you're struggling. As soon as you stop \nstruggling you're finished.\" If we're struggling it means that we want to overcome these bad influences. \nThose who don't want to overcome them, think it's natural to be lusty. It's natural to be envious. They \ndon't think they are in illusion because they think illusion is reality.\nWe should therefore struggle to find the spiritual strength to overcome these enemies. That much \nstruggling we have to do. If we don't struggle for that, we'll have to struggle with material nature, \nwhich is very hard on the living entity, and causes so much anxiety.\nPrabhupada says that this material world is kuntha. It is a place of anxiety. It cannot be avoided. \nEverything in this world is temporary and the eternal living entity is going to have to be in anxiety \nabout losing that which he is attached to. So he struggles with this illusory energy.\nA devotee therefore prays. \"Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare/ Hare Rama Hare Rama \nRama Rama Hare Hare.\" He's praying to Krsna. He's praying to Lord Balarama. \"Please give me the \nstrength so that I may be engaged in Krsna's service.\" He's praying to Srimati Radharani. Please engage\nme in Krsna's service. He's looking for strength. This is his struggle.\nSo just as this verse states that \"As long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and\nparaphernalia, which are not fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, \nnamely his spiritual master and the spiritual master's predecessors.\"\nSo let me read the purport. Please take note of the emphasis Srila Prabhupada is making about strength.\nIt's a little bit long. Try to listen carefully.\nIn Bhagavad-gita (4.9) the Lord says:\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\" This is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\nIn other words, this is what it means to accept help from the superiors is to go back home, back to \nGodhead. This is the destination that Krsna wants all living entities to achieve. And Lord Balarama and\nthose in the line of Lord Balarama are meant to give us the strength to go back to the spiritual world.\nThis is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\n... to go back home, back to Godhead.\nIt is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.20.17):\nnr-deham adyam sulabham sudurlabham\nplavam sukalpam guru-karnadharam\n\nmayanukulena nabhasvateritam\npuman bhavabdhim na taret sa atma-ha\nThis human form of body is a most valuable boat, and the spiritual master is the captain, guru-\nkarnadharam, to guide the boat in plying across the ocean of nescience. The instruction of Krsna \nis a favorable breeze. One must use all these facilities to cross over the ocean of nescience. Since \nthe spiritual master is the captain, one must serve the spiritual master very sincerely so that by his\nmercy one will be able to get the mercy of the Supreme Lord.\nA significant word here is acyuta-balah. The spiritual master is certainly very merciful to his \ndisciples, and consequently by satisfying him a devotee gets strength from the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore says, guru-krsna-prasade paya \nbhakti-lata-bija: [Cc. Madhya 19.151] one must first please the spiritual master, and then one \nautomatically pleases Krsna and gets the strength with which to cross the ocean of nescience.\nThis is the point I was making before. Simply knowledge, is insufficient. One can study the Vedas for \nmillions of births, as Lord Brahma says in Brahma Samhita, and still never be able to understand \nKrsna. So it's not simply by knowledge that one can cross the ocean of material existence.\nThe purport continues:\nIf one seriously desires to return home, back to Godhead, one must therefore become strong \nenough by pleasing the spiritual master, for thus one gets the weapon with which to conquer the \nenemy, and one also gets the grace of Krsna. Simply getting the weapon of jnana is insufficient. \nOne must sharpen the weapon by serving the spiritual master and adhering to his instructions. \nThen the candidate will get the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nPrabhupada then gives a nice analogy.\nIn general warfare one must take help from his chariot and horses in order to conquer his enemy, \nand after conquering his enemies he may give up the chariot and its paraphernalia. Similarly, as \nlong as one has a human body, one should fully use it to obtain the highest perfection of life, \nnamely going back home, back to Godhead.\nUsing the human form of life to its full potential.\nkamasya nendriya-pritir\nlabho jiveta yavata\njivasya tattva-jijnasa\nnartho yas ceha karmabhih\nLife's desires should never be directed toward sense gratification. One should desire only a healthy life,\nor self-preservation, since a human being is meant for inquiry about the Absolute Truth. Nothing else \nshould be the goal of one's works. (SB 1.2.10)\nThe perfection of knowledge is certainly to become transcendentally situated (brahma-bhuta [SB \n4.30.20]). As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):\n\nbrahma-bhutah prasannatma\nna socati na kanksati\nsamah sarvesu bhutesu\nmad-bhaktim labhate param\n\"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully \njoyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living \nentities. In that state he attains pure devotional service.\" Simply by cultivating knowledge as the \nimpersonalists do, one cannot get out of the clutches of maya. One must attain the platform of \nbhakti.\nbhaktya mam abhijanati\nyavan yas casmi tattvatah\ntato mam tattvato jnatva\nvisate tad-anantaram\n\"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one \nis in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of \nGod.\" (Bg. 18.55) Unless one has attained the stage of devotional service and the mercy of the \nspiritual master and Krsna, there is a possibility that one may fall down and again accept a \nmaterial body. Therefore Krsna stresses in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\"\nThe word tattvatah, meaning \"in reality,\" is very important. Tato mam tattvato jnatva. Unless one \nunderstands Krsna in truth by the mercy of the spiritual master, one is not free to give up his \nmaterial body.\nIn other words, one has to accept another material body.\n4\nAs it is said, aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah: [SB \n10.2.32] if one neglects to serve the lotus feet of Krsna, one cannot become free from the material\nclutches simply by knowledge. Even if one attains the stage of brahma-padam, merging in \nBrahman, without bhakti he is prone to fall down. One must be very careful in regard to the \ndanger of falling down again into material bondage. The only insurance is to come to the stage of \nbhakti, from which one is sure not to fall. Then one is free from the activities of the material \nworld. In summary, as stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, one must get in touch with a bona fide\nspiritual master coming in the parampara of Krsna consciousness, for by his mercy and \n\ninstructions one is able to get strength from Krsna. Thus one engages in devotional service and \nattains the ultimate goal of life, the lotus feet of Visnu.\nSignificant in this verse are the words jnanasim acyuta-balah. Jnanasim, the sword of knowledge, \nis given by Krsna, and when one serves the guru and Krsna in order to hold the sword of Krsna's \ninstructions, Balarama gives one strength. Balarama is Nityananda. Vrajendra-nandana yei, saci-\nsuta haila sei, balarama ha-ila nitai. This bala -- Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya \nMahaprabhu, and both of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take \nshelter of Their lotus feet. They come especially to deliver the fallen souls of this age, papi tapi \nyata chila, hari-name uddharila. Their weapon is sankirtana, hari-nama. Thus one should accept \nthe sword of knowledge from Krsna and be strong with the mercy of Balarama. We are therefore \nworshiping Krsna-Balarama in Vrndavana. In the Mundaka Upanisad (3.2.4) it is said:\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvams\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nOne cannot attain the goal of life without the mercy of Balarama. Sri Narottama dasa Thakura \ntherefore says, nitaiyera karuna habe, vraje radha-krsna pabe: when one receives the mercy of \nBalarama, Nityananda, one can attain the lotus feet of Radha and Krsna very easily.\nse sambandha nahi yara,   \nbrtha janma gela tara,\nvidya-kule hi karibe tara\nIf one has no connection with Nitai, Balarama, then even though one is a very learned scholar or \njnani or has taken birth in a very respectable family, these assets will not help him. We must \ntherefore conquer the enemies of Krsna consciousness with the strength received from Balarama. \n[end of purport]\nThese enemies are like whips. They are beating us again and again, keeping us in the bodily \nidentification. Imagine living with enemies. We are living with enemies right in our own bodies.\nKrsna described the enemy as lust. When Arjuna asked Krsna, \"What is it Krsna that compels a person \nto act even against his own will?\" Krsna replied that \"It's lust only Arjuna which is later transformed in \nanger, which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world.\" How to conquer this enemy on our own \nstrength?\nThose who try to do it on the strength of their own intelligence,\ntvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\n (SB 10.2.32)\n\n[...]their intelligence is impure. They fall down from their position of imagined superiority because \nthey have no regard for Your lotus feet.\nThey are destined to fall, because they haven't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus feet. They haven't taken \nshelter of Lord Balarama. They haven't taken shelter of bhakti, which manifests through the mercy of \nthe spiritual and the predecessor spiritual masters.\nThe spiritual master must represent the predecessor spiritual masters. Only by representing the \npredecessor spiritual master can one strive to achieve the Lord by the right means.\nThe verse nayam atma bala hinena labhyo clearly states that one has to achieve the Lord by the right \nmeans. One should not be wild or careless. By the right means Krsna reveals Himself and one enters \nthe spiritual world.\n5\nThis is the meaning of akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda guru tattva means that Lord Balarama manifests \nHimself as guru in an unlimited variety of forms. And it is the service of guru to give one the strength \nto cross over the ocean of material existence to enter into the spiritual world.\nSo this is how we worship Lord Balarama on His appearance day. We should know that He is adi-guru. \nHe is the original guru and and all other gurus represent Him. Without His mercy, without taking \nshelter of Him, we will never be able to give up this sense gratification and attachment to the material \nworld.\nAs described in the song Gauranga Bolite Ha'be, Narottama das Thakur is praying.\nara kabe nitai-candera karuna karibe\nsamsara-vasana mora kabe tuccha habe\n\"When will Lord Nityananda have mercy upon me so that I can realize the uselessness of material \npleasure?'\nHe is praying in that way. Who is Nityananda? He is Lord Balarama. Nityananda is the same as Lord \nBalarama. He has appeared to serve Lord Caitanya in the same way as Lord Balarama has appeared to \nserve Lord Krsna.\nAnd as Prabhupada says in today's purport, \"Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and \nboth of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take shelter of Their lotus \nfeet.\"\nWhat is their weapon?\nkrsna-varnam tvisakrsnam\nsangopangastra-parsadam\nSB 11.5.32\nThe verse describes how Lord Caitanya appears with His weapons. What is Lord Caitanya's weapon? \nHe's not coming to chop off heads. Not coming with a club to beat and destroy. He's coming with the \nweapon of harinama sankirtan. That is the weapon He has come with in this age of Kali.\n\nSrila Bhaktisiddhanti Sarasvati Thakur describes in one article of the Harmonist Magazine.\n\"Nityananda alone possesses the distinctive function of the guru. In Nityananda the function is \nembodied. Nityananda is the servant-God. He serves Sri Gaurasundara by the distinctive method of \nreverential servitude. He is identical with Sri Balarama of krsna-lila.[...]\n[...]\"But Nityananda does not directly instruct in the confidential service of Krsna. Srimati Radhika is \nthe guru of the inner circle of the servants of Krsna. Srimati Radhika, however, accepts the offer of \nservice of only those souls who are specially favored by Nityananda and are deemed by Him to be fit \nfor Her service.\nSo in all respects we are dependent upon the mercy of Nityananda Balarama to become qualifided to \ndance in the spiritual world and to be fully engaged in loving devotional service to the Lord.\nThis is the goal. Prabhupada clearly states this right from the outset of the verse. The goal is to go back \nhome, back to Godhead. The goal is not to be happy in this material world.\nThe devotee who understands this goal may become happy in this world. But as Rupa Goswami says, \nthere is three types of happiness. 1) Happiness derived from sense gratification, which is temporary. 2) \nHappiness which comes from liberation, which can also be temporary.\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\nOne will fall down from his position of imagined superiority if he hasn't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus \nfeet. And 3) The happiness which comes from bhakti, by realizing\njivera 'svarupa' haya -- krsnera 'nitya-dasa'\nI am Krsna's eternal servant, and my only business in life is to find shelter at His lotus feet. This is real \nhappiness.\nBy the mercy of guru, by the mercy of predecessor gurus, and by the mercy of Lord Balarama. This is \nwhat it means to take shelter. And this is why we observe Lord Balarama's appearance day... to pray for\nthis strength.\nHare Krsna","attachment_name":"balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf","attachment_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/sites/default/files/attachments/balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf"},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"ru":{"title":"26 августа, 2018 - Алматы, Казахстан - Лекция на Баларама Пурниме - Английский/ Русский","event":"Festival","topic":"Шримад Бхагаватам","translation":"Русский","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"","attachment_name":""},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"counters":{"audio_page_view":0,"audio_play_count":0,"downloads":"147","video_page_view":0,"en_transcription_view":0,"ru_transcription_view":0,"en_summary_view":0,"ru_summary_view":0}},{"uuid":"eb9ba9ea-4a8e-4ab5-9a58-03009d5e764e","needs_translation":true,"created_date":"2018-08-11","published_date":"","author":"Niranjana Swami","part":"4","chapter":"30","verse":"10","download_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/download/33333","lecture_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/en/lecture/26394","duration":"01:56:48","downloads":"129","audio_link":"https://nrs-site.s3.amazonaws.com/lectures/2018/2018-08/2018.08.11_e.s.nirandzhana_svami._shb-4.30.10_retrit.magdalinovka-lower_compression.mp3","soundCloud_link":"https://soundcloud.com/niranjana-swami/august-11-2013-disciple","youtube":"","en":{"title":"August 11, 2018 - Disciple Retreat - Magdalinivka - SB 4.30.10 - English/ Russian","event":"Retreat","topic":"Srimad Bhagavatam","translation":"Russian","location":"Magdalinivka","transcription":{"text":"\n\nAugust 11, 2018 – Disciple Retreat in Magdalinivka – SB 4.30.10 \n \nThe following is a partially-edited transcription of a lecture given on August 11, 2018, at the \nDisciple Retreat in Magdalinivka, Ukraine: \n \n \nye tu mam rudra-gitena \nsayam pratah samahitah \nstuvanty aham kama-varan \ndasye prajnam ca sobhanam \n \nTRANSLATION \nThose who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence. \n \nPURPORT \nGood intelligence means going back home, back to Godhead. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita \n(10.10): \n \ntesam satata-yuktanam \nbhajatam priti-purvakam \ndadami buddhi-yogam tam \nyena mam upayanti te \n \n\"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by \nwhich they can come to Me.\" \n \nOne who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know that the highest \nperfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this verse it is \nindicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracetas, the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is \nthe way of the parampara system. If we follow the acaryas, we attain the same benefit as our \npredecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly \nhearing Bhagavad-gita from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no difference \nbetween hearing Bhagavad-gita directly from the Supreme Lord and following a personality like \nArjuna, who formerly heard Bhagavad-gita directly from the Lord. Sometimes foolish people \nargue that since Krsna is not present at the moment, one cannot take direct instructions from \nHim. Such foolish people do not know that there is no difference between directly hearing \nBhagavad-gita and reading it, as long as one accepts Bhagavad-gita as it is, spoken by the Lord. \nHowever, if one wants to understand Bhagavad-gita by his imperfect interpretations, one \ncannot possibly understand the mysteries of Bhagavad-gita, even though one may be a great \n\nscholar according to mundane estimation. \n \nNiranjana Swami: \n \nI'd like to put this verse a little bit into context before we speak about the purport Srila \nPrabhupada gave on the verse.  \n \nThis verse is spoken about the Pracetas, the sons of King Pracinabarhisat. King Pracinabarhisat \nbecame known as a Prajapati entrusted with the responsibility to create progeny. He had ten \nsons. He instructed his sons to prepare for householder life which for them meant to perform \nausterities for 10,000 years.  \n \nWhile traveling west to execute their father's order, they come upon a big lake, so big that it \nlooked like an ocean. They became captivated by the beautiful appearance of this lake. All of a \nsudden, they heard the sounds of drums, kettledrums and other instruments being played. The \nsounds were coming from within the lake. Just then, appearing from within the lake appeared \nLord Siva. Lord Siva came to them because he understood them to be highly qualified persons.  \n \nAn interesting point which I noticed when I was looking at these verses this morning is that Lord \nSiva was also attracted to the Pracetas because they were dedicated to following the order of \ntheir father. Prabhupada said in the purport that because they were surrendered to following \nthat order, Lord Siva saw the Pracetas as highly qualified persons and therefore he wanted to \ngive His association to them.  \n \nI bring this point up because yesterday we were talking about Dhruva Maharaja who was fixed \non the order of his mother. His mother requested him to follow the recommendations of his \nstepmother Suruci... to go to the forest to seek out the Supreme Lord, again, for the fulfillment \nof his desire. That point is made today in this verse also. By offering this prayer given by Lord \nSiva, the Lord told the Pracetas, \"they can both fulfill their desires and attain good intelligence.\" \n \nDhruva Maharaja went to the forest to seek out the Supreme Lord because he also wanted the \nfulfillment of his desires. We didn't speak that much on that point yesterday, but we know what \nhis desires were.  \n \nDhruva Maharaja was insulted and wanted revenge. He wanted to get a kingdom better than \nhis father's, grandfather's and great-grandfather's. He was so fixed on his mother's instructions \nthat when Narada Muni, who saw Dhruva Maharaja as a good candidate just as Lord Siva saw \nthe Pracetas as good candidates, gave Dhruva Maharaja instructions to return home, Dhruva \nMaharaja was more intent on going to the forest to obtain the darshan of the Supreme Lord. He \nhad desires he wanted fulfilled from Him.  \n \nNarada Muni tested Dhruva by instructing him, \"Just become equipoised, be self-satisfied. Do \nnot be disturbed by these things you are feeling in your heart, The forest is no place for a young \nboy like you. You're too young for such austerities. Wait until you are older.\", Dhruva Maharaja \n\nwas nonetheless fixed. \"No I have to seek out the Supreme Lord. I was told by my mother that \nHe can take care of everything for me. Sorry I know those are good instructions, but they don't \ntouch my heart. I've got something else on my mind. \n \nDhruva was fixed. \"I was told by my mother that the Lord will take care of my desires. She told \nme to go to the forest and you're telling me, 'Don't go to the forest.'\"  \n \nNarada Muni, an expert judge of time, place, and circumstances, then adjusted everything. He \nstill saw Dhruva as a good candidate and gave him instructions how he could get his desires \nfulfilled.  \n \nInterestingly, because it's similar to what we are going to hear about the Pracetas, Narada Muni \nalso gave Dhruva Maharaja a mantra to chant. He told him, \"If you chant this mantra you will be \nblessed by the Lord according to your desire.\" Srila Prabhupada explained in one purport in that \nsection about Dhruva Maharaja, that Dhruva Maharaja was initiated in the Visnu-mantra and \nwas given the mantra \"om namo bhagavate vasudevaya.\" \n \nIn the pastime with the Pracetas, the Pracetas had an order from their father. They were strictly \nfollowing his order, Lord Siva appeared to them, saw them as highly qualified persons, and told \nthem that because they were so qualified, he wanted to give them a mantra, or stotra, to \nchant. He told them that by chanting this mantra, \"...you will certainly achieve all your desired \nobjectives without fail.\" SB 4.24.79 \n \nIn connection to this point, I wanted to read a few verses from a previous chapter,  \n \n\"Although rendering devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and worshiping \nHim are very difficult, if one vibrates or simply reads this stotra [prayer] composed and sung by \nme [Lord Siva], he will very easily be able to invoke the mercy of the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead.\" (SB 4.24.76) \n \n\"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the dearmost objective of all auspicious benedictions. \nA human being who sings this song sung by me can please the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead. Such a devotee, being fixed in the Lord's devotional service, can acquire whatever he \nwants from the Supreme Lord. (SB 4.24.77) \n \nIn other words, Lord Siva is telling them, \"You can get whatever you desire to accomplish. \nWorship the Lord and get the fulfillment of your desire.\"  \n \nAnd in today's verse, after gaining darshan of the Lord, the Lord told the Pracetas,  \n \n\"Those who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence.\" (SB 4.30.10 \n \n\nAnd what did Prabhupada say in the purport today? What is good intelligence? Anyone \nremember what Prabhupada said? Yes...to go back to Godhead. That is good intelligence. He \nquotes the verse,  \n \ntesam satata-yuktanam \nbhajatam priti-purvakam \ndadami buddhi-yogam tam \nyena mam upayanti te \n \n\"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by \nwhich they can come to Me.\" (BG 10.10) \n \nThis is good intelligence. One gets the fulfillment of his desires and goes back to Godhead.  \n \nDhruva Maharaja got the fulfillment of his desires. However, in this case, when the Lord \nappeared to Dhruva and revealed all the desires that He would fulfill for him, Dhruva Maharaja \nwas completely distressed.  \n \nSomeone might ask, \"Why was he distressed? He got the fulfillment of his desires.\" But \nVisvanath Cakravarti Thakur explains that Dhruva Maharaja was distressed because the Lord \nfulfilled his previous desires. And after getting the darshan of the Lord, he realized that those \nprevious desires were so paltry, so petty. \n \nWhat were his previous desires? He wanted revenge. He wanted a kingdom. When the Lord \nappeared before Dhruva Maharaja, He told Dhruva Maharaja, \"You will get your father's throne \nand you will rule your father's kingdom for 36,000 years.\" That's what Dhruva wanted. He was \npreviously thinking, \"I couldn't sit on my father's lap. I want to be able to sit on the throne.\" But \nhe wanted something even greater than that. We'll get to that.  \n \nBut the first thing the Lord said was that \"You will rule the kingdom for 36,000 years. You will \nperform sacrifices. But you will remember Me. There will be no obstacles in your service as \nKing. You will remember the goal of your sacrifices.\" \n \nThe Lord detailed how Dhruva will rule his father's kingdom. After that, he will have a kingdom \neven better than Lord Brahma's. He will have his own planet, the polestar within this universe. \nWhen all planets in this universe are destroyed at the time of universal devastation, the \npolestar will remain. So ultimately he would rule a kingdom even better than Lord Brahma's.  \n \nIn addition, the Lord also told Dhruva, \"Your stepbrother will go to the forest to hunt and he will \nbe killed. Your stepmother, when she hears that her son has been killed in the forest, out of \ngreat despair, she will enter into the forest to look for her son and she will be devoured by a \nforest fire.\"  \n \nThese points were spoken directly to Dhruva by the Lord. And then the Lord departed.  \n\n \nAlthough Dhruva got the fulfillment of his desires, he was lamenting. \"What is the value of \nthose desires in relation to what I just experienced in the darshan of the Lord?\"  \n \nAdditionally, when the Lord appeared to Dhruva, Dhruva became so overwhelmed, he offered \nprayers to glorify the Lord. In those prayers which he personally composed, he asked for only \none benediction from the Lord. \"Please let me always be in the association of Your devotees.\" \n \nHowever, the Lord departed without saying anything about his new request. Visvanath \nCakravarti Thakur explains that that was the reason why Dhruva Maharaja was thrown into \nlamentation even though he got the darshan of the Lord. Dhruva realized that, \"The Lord \nfulfilled all of my previous desires, but He didn't respond to what I said when I saw Him.\" \nDhruva was therefore condemning himself, saying, \"I have prayed only for useless things. My \nactivities were exactly like treatment given to a person who is already dead.\" (SB 4.9.34) \n \nAnyway, Dhruva Maharaja received the fulfilment of his desires. After ruling his father's \nkingdom for 36,000 years, when it was time for him to go to his next destination, a flower \nairplane descended from Vaikuntha. Death personified appeared before him. Death personified \nis a very fearful personality to behold. Most living beings do not know how to deal with this \npersonality. But what did Dhruva Maharaja do? He stepped on the head of death personified \nand used his head as a step to get into the flower airplane to go back to Godhead. \n \nIn this connection, Narada Muni gives the analogy how lightning and illumination appear \nsimultaneously. Death is also like that for those who are fully absorbed in thinking of Krsna. This \nis how important it is to be engaged fully in devotional service. In that state of consciousness, \none is prepared to meet death personified. The transition becomes easier for a devotee fully \nengaged in devotional service.  \n \nIn summary, Dhruva Maharaja got the fulfillment of his desires. Because he worshipped the \nLord and faithfully chanted the mantra given to him by Narada Muni, he ultimately went back \nto Godhead. \n \nLord Siva is telling the Pracetas the same thing, \"Chant this prayer I've given to you, be fixed in \ndevotional service, and one can acquire whatever he wants from the Lord.\" \n \nIn an earlier chapter, it is stated,  \n \n\"A devotee who rises early in the morning and with folded hands chants these prayers sung by \nLord Siva and gives facility to others to hear them certainly becomes free from all bondage to \nfruitive activities.\" (SB 4.24.78) \n \n\"My dear sons of the King, the prayers I have recited to you are meant for pleasing the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead, the Supersoul. I advise you to recite these prayers, which are as \neffective as great austerities.\" (SB 4.24.79) \n\n \nThe Pracetas, received and accepted these prayers. They then performed austerities for 10,000 \nyears while meditating on these prayers that were given to them by Lord Siva. \n \nAfter performing their austerities and chanting this prayer, the Lord appeared to the Pracetas. \nThe Lord, being very pleased by their austerities, spoke an often-quoted verse expressing His \npleasure with the Pracetas' austerities.  \n \n\"The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear sons of the King, I am very much pleased \nby the friendly relationships among you. All of you are engaged in one occupation -- devotional \nservice. I am so pleased with your mutual friendship that I wish you all good fortune. Now you \nmay ask a benediction of Me.\" (SB 4.30.8) \n \nThis is the verse where Srila Prabhupada speaks about unity in devotional service in his purport.  \n \n\"The Lord continued: Those who remember you every evening of every day will become \nfriendly with their brothers and with all other living entities. (SB 4.30.9) \n \nThe Pracetas also offered prayers to the Lord. This is proper... to begin with glorification. We \nshould not just ask for the fulfillment of our desires. Neither does a devotee think, \"If I glorify \nthe Lord I'll get a better chance of getting my desire fulfilled.\" A devotee glorifies the Lord \nbecause he has understood the true glories of the Lord, and therefore he glorifies the Lord's \nqualities, His beauty, His characteristics, His dealings with devotees, His opulences, etc..  \n \nIn addition, in their prayers, the Pracetas requested, ...\"we pray that You will be satisfied with \nus. That is our benediction. We do not desire anything other than Your full satisfaction.\" (SB \n4.30.30) \n \nAnd their other request was: \n \n\"Dear Lord, as long as we have to remain within this material world due to our material \ncontamination and wander from one type of body to another and from one planet to another, \nwe pray that we may associate with those who are engaged in discussing Your pastimes. We \npray for this benediction life after life, in different bodily forms and on different planets.\" (SB \n4.30.33) \n \nWhy do we read, again and again, that devotees who are in the presence of the Lord, pray, \"Let \nme have the association of Your devotees?\" There must be a certain special quality of devotees \nthat inspires devotees to ask the Lord, \"Let me be in the association of Your devotees.\" \n \nThe devotee thinks, \"If I could be in the association of devotees who are always glorifying You, \nthen I'm protected. I'll never be able to forget You.\" That is what a devotee wants. Under all \ncircumstances, he wants to be able to remember the Lord. A devotee thinks, \"If I'm in the \nassociation of devotees who are always glorifying You, how can I forget You?\" \n\n \nThere are so many verses which give emphasis to the value of devotee association. \nIn fact it was Narada Muni who said to King Pracinibarhisat, the father of the Pracetas:  \n \n\"My dear King, in the place where pure devotees live, following the rules and regulations and \nthus purely conscious and engaged with great eagerness in hearing and chanting the glories of \nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, in that place if one gets a chance to hear their constant \nflow of nectar, which is exactly like the waves of a river, one will forget the necessities of life -- \nnamely hunger and thirst -- and become immune to all kinds of fear, lamentation and illusion.\" \n(SB 4.29.39–40) \n \nNarada Muni was giving King Pracinabarhisat good instruction. When Narada Muni first visited \nthe king he was trying to get him to give up his attachment to fruitive activities. He told the \nallegorical story of King Puranjana in an attempt to convince him to give up his attachments. \nAfter hearing about Puranjana and then receiving further instruction from Narada Muni, the \nKing achieved liberation and then the story of King Pracinabarhisat was finished. Vidura then \nasked Maitreya, \"Can you go back to the Pracetas? What happened to them? What did they \nachieve?\" \n \nSo as we were explaining before, the Pracetas got the darshan of the Lord. The Lord asked them \nfor a benediction and their only requests were, \"We ask that you be satisfied by our devotional \nservice and that we have the association of devotees.\" \n \nLet us remember, however, that they were performing austerities under the request of their \nfather who told them to prepare for householder life. So they wanted to fulfill the desire of \ntheir father. So what did the Lord tell them? He said that, \"Because you are all united in \ndevotional service, you will all have your own kingdoms.\" \n \nImagine, each of them having their own kingdoms with no quarreling amongst themselves. The \nLord said, \"You will always have friendly relationships with your brothers and friendly \nrelationships towards all living entities.\" And then He told them, \"You will rule those kingdoms \nfor one million years.\" A million years! Of course, it's a million of our years. In celestial years, it \nwould be less. \n \nAs the Lord told Prahlada Maharaja, He similarly told the Pracetas, \"You will always be engaged \nin sacrifice. I'll be satisfied by your sacrifices so that you will not forget the actual goal.\" \n \nSometimes one may think that, \"Once one gets the darshan of the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead one soon goes back to Godhead.\" It's like the happy ending of the story. He gets the \ndarshan of the Lord and then goes back to Godhead. But here we see in the case of Dhruva \nMaharaja, he remained, reigning over his father's kingdom for 36,000 years. With the \nPracetas... they were ruling over their kingdoms for one million years. But they would perform \ntheir duties in this world without forgetting the Lord.  \n \n\nThat is what Prabhupada explained in his purports, that we perform our duties in this world, we \ntake the mantra which has been given to us, we chant that mantra, obtaining the association of \nthe Lord, and then after performing our duties in this world perfectly in Krsna consciousness, \nwe go back to Godhead.  \n \nIt's how we are supposed to live in this world. It's not that we are all just going to chant and \nwait for the Lord to appear to deliver us. No. We must understand how to perform our duties in \nthis world, especially those duties which have been entrusted to us and take the mantra which \nhas been given to us.  \n \nSrila Prabhupada compared the mantra given to the Pracetas by Lord Siva to receiving the Hare \nKrsna mantra. By performing our duties in Krsna consciousness while chanting the Hare Krsna \nmahamantra, at the appropriate time, all perfection will be there.  \n \nThe point that Srila Prabhupada makes in today's purport is that we should follow the decisions \nmade by those persons who received instructions from the Lord. Following their decisions is as \ngood as receiving instructions from the Lord.  \n \nPrabhupada says, \"One who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know \nthat the highest perfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this \nverse it is indicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracetas, the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is \nthe way of the parampara system. If we follow the acaryas, we attain the same benefit as our \npredecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly \nhearing Bhagavad-gita from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. (SB 4.30.10 Purport) \n \nOne follows the decisions of Arjuna. In other words, by having examples to follow we get \nstrength, courage, enthusiasm and determination to continue to execute our duties in this life.  \n \nWe oftentimes quote Sri Bhaktyaloka. We referred to that quote yesterday.  \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur explains: \n \n\"After receiving initiation and instructions from a bona fide guru, a fortunate disciple should \nfollow the path of the previous sadhus. Those who are proud neglect the previous mahajanas \nand create new paths. As a result, they soon proceed on their inauspicious path and ruin \nthemselves. It is said in the Skanda Purana: \n \nsa mrgyah sreyasam hetuh \npanthah santapa-varjitah \nanavapta-sramam purve \nyena santah pratasthire \n \n\n\"One should strictly follow the easy path which the previous mahajanas have accepted. That \npath bestows great auspiciousness and is devoid of all misery.\" (Sri Bhaktyaloka, Chapter 10) \n  \nWe speak on this point a lot. Actually this is the point I was asked to speak on today. I am just \ngetting to it now. But it's all connected. It's connected to Dhruva Maharaja, it's connected to \nthe Pracetas, it's connected to Haridas Thakur about whom Bhaktivinode Thakur speaks. He \nsays that we have to have examples, our mahajanas, from whom we take shelter. We must try \nto remember their activities and to remember their decisions in order to get strength. \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur continues,  \n \n\"By discussing the path of the previous sadhus, one gets determination, courage, and \nsatisfaction. \n \nWho does Bhaktivinode Thakur use as an example? He uses the example of Haridas Thakur. \nHaridas Thakur's path wasn't such an easy path to follow. But Bhaktivinode Thakur says that by \nremembering his path it becomes easy.  \n \nDoes that mean that we have to beaten through twenty-two marketplaces? Do we have to be \nthreatened to be killed? Persecuted? Haridas Thakur was subjected to so much. He was \ndragged to prison and threatened by the Kazi. He was told to give up his convictions and to stop \nchanting the holy names. Haridas Thakur's response was, \"You can cut my body to pieces but I \nwill never give up chanting the holy name of the Lord.\" \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur explains that Haridas Thakur taught by his example three very important \nprinciples to be followed by those who follow in the footsteps of previous sadhus. The first, is \nthat one must always be determined, in all circumstances, that \"Yes. I must be determined to \nexecute my duties in this world while remembering the Lord.  \n \nThe second is to never give up the chanting of Hare Krishna.  \n \nThe third principle is to be compassionate towards all other living beings. \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur says that this is the path given by our previous acaryas which must be \nfollowed. It's the easy path. What makes it the easy path to follow? Austerities for 10,000 years \nunder the water? This is the easy path to follow? To go to the forest to eat berries and dried   \nleaves, to then give up all eating, by living off breath alone? To perform severe austerities \nstanding on one toe? This is the easy path? To be threatened, to be beaten in twenty-two \nmarketplaces until death? This is the easy path I'm supposed to follow? \n \nBy remembering them or by following their decisions, whatever difficulties or obstacles we \nneed to overcome become easier for us to surrender. Without an example it's very difficult to \ndo something on our own. \n \n\nTherefore Bhaktivinode Thakur says that those who are proud create their own paths.  \n \n\"Those who are proud neglect the previous mahajanas and create new paths. As a result, they \nsoon proceed on their inauspicious path and ruin themselves.\" (Sri Bhaktyaloka, Chapter 10) \n \nIn other words, they have no one to follow for spiritual strength.  \n \nWe accept the path established by our mahajanas as our examples to follow. By remembering \nthem, whatever difficulties we have to undergo become easier. In comparison to them, our \nausterities are small. We make ourselves think that they are just so big, so difficult, impossible \nto overcome. \"How can I ever do it? This is too much.\" \n \nBut by remembering those who made good decisions and who showed by their example how \nthey crossed the ocean of material existence and went back home, back to Godhead, we get \nstrength, courage, determination and enthusiasm. It makes it easier. That's how it becomes the \neasy path. \n \nIn this regard, I've been telling devotees recently a very practical story I experienced. It means a \nlot to me. It moves my heart. It's what gave me strength. I'm sure that many have heard this \nstory, but I'll tell it again. I love telling it.  \n \nSarvajna dasa: About Sridhara Maharaja?  \n \nYes Sridhara Maharaja. It's such a perfect example. By remembering Sridhara Maharaja, I got \nstrength. We had a previous friendly relationship with each other before he came to Mayapura \nin 2004. When Sridhara Maharaja came to Mayapura, he understood he would soon be leaving \nthis world. He had two desires he wanted fulfilled before departing. He wanted to go to \nMayapura to take part in the installation of Panca Tattva and he wanted to be with his \ngodbrothers.  \n \nHe expressed those desires when he was told by Canadian doctors that he couldn't receive a \nliver transplant because the cancer had spread too far in his body. From Canada, he met \nIndradyumna Maharaja in London and then the two of them came together to Mayapura.  \n \nSridhara Maharaja liked my kirtans. One time when Sridhara Maharaja was staying in a \ndevotee's flat near Bhaktivedanta Hospital at the same time I was being treated in \nBhaktivedanta Hospital, Sridhara Maharaja called me and asked, \"Maharaja can you come over \nand chant with me?\" He was not terminally ill at that time. But he was having a lot of health \nproblems. He was staying in an apartment trying to recover from an earlier treatment.  \n \nSo as soon as I had an opportunity I went over and visited Maharaja. When I arrived I expressed \nhow happy I was to see him. The first thing he said to me was, \"You see that harmonium over \nthere? Can we chant?\" It was just myself and Sridhara Maharaja. The two of us just sat and had \nkirtan together. \n\n \nAnother time when he was in Bombay, Maharaja asked again if I could come. But I couldn't go \nthat time. I believe he was again staying someplace near the hospital in Bombay but I was in \nPune at the Pune Yatra. From Pune I had to immediately go someplace else. So I asked \nMaharaja to forgive me. I told him I couldn't come that time but next time I would definitely \nmake the time to visit and chant together with him. \n \nThe next time I saw Maharaja was in Mayapura. A large group of devotees assembled to receive \nhim. It was a wonderful reception. There's a little funny story in this connection. When \nMaharaja arrived he had all this red around his mouth. It looked like it was blood. When the \ndevotees saw him they were shocked, but nobody wanted to say anything. They came down \nand sat in the room with Sridhara Maharaja who then said, \"I was eating red candy.\"  \n \nAnyway, when I saw Sridhara Maharaja, I embraced him and I said, \"Sridhara Maharaja I'm just \nso happy to see you.\" One of Maharaja's desires was also to have was kirtan in his room every \nnight. So when I embraced Maharaja I just said, \"Maharaja if you want me, I'm available 24/7.\"    \n \nAs it turned out, Sridhara Maharaja did take part in the abhiseka. There are many pictures of \nhim bathing Lord Caitanya during the Panca Tattva abhiseka. He was so absorbed. After the \ndeities were installed Sridhara Maharaja was more or less restricted to his room. It was then \nwhen he had devotees come to his room every evening for kirtan.  \n \nMaharaja was oftentimes lying during these evening kirtans. He couldn't get up. His body was \nswollen, although he had a way of dismissing these things. Sridhara Maharaja was known as the \n\"Jolly Swami.\" He was happy to be in the association of devotees. Sometimes his stomach \nwould swell up with fluids and the doctors had to come in to remove the fluids from his \nstomach. His brothers and a couple of other devotees were there one time when the doctors \ncame in to do the procedure. Sridhara Maharaja turned to the doctor and said, \"It's a boy.\" \n \nAnyway, Maharaja's room was full of devotees, every night. Sridhara Maharaja, because he was \nlying in bed, would oftentimes dance with his arms because he couldn't get up to sit with the \ndevotees. He would say, \"Forgive me, I can't dance, but I'm dancing with you with my arms.\"  \n \nOne night, after the GBC meetings, I had a terrible headache. I was thinking, \"I don't know if I \ncan go to the kirtan tonight with this bad headache.\" I was of two minds. \"I told Sridhara \nMaharaja that I would be there every night, but maybe tonight is an exception.\" \n \nSo after the meeting, I wrote note to Mayapura dasa, Sridhara Maharaja's secretary. I wrote \nsomething like, \"Mayapura, could you please tell Sridhara Maharaja to forgive me. I'm not \ncoming this evening. I have a terrible headache. I'm going back to my room.\" At that time I was \nstaying in the Vaisnava Academy. I had to walk a bit of a distance from the meetings to the \nacademy. While I was walking to the academy, I started to think of Sridhara Maharaja. \"Wait a \nminute. Sridhara Maharaja is lying in bed with a terminal illness, having kirtan. He's in pain. \nWhat is my headache compared to what he is going through? I have a headache. But Sridhara \n\nMaharaja is dancing with his arms with the devotees in kirtan, and I have a little headache.\" \n \nWhile meditating on that, I started to think, \"Oh I better turn around. I better go back.\" What \nseemed to be very significant became insignificant by meditating on his example. I got strength \nfrom that example. So I went back, directly to Sridhara Maharaja's room. I opened up the door, \nstood in the doorway, and the room was full as it always was. I didn't want to go in because I \ndidn't want to step over any of the devotees. But Sridhara Maharaja looked up and saw me. He \nhad received the message from Mayapura. Maharaja looked at me and said, \"Come here.\" And I \nsaid, \"Maharaja, I don't want to disrupt all of the devotees.\" And Sridhara Maharaja said, \"No. \nCome here.\" And he told the devotees. \"Make room for Niranjana Swami.\" \n \nSo, I had to follow his instructions. He's my superior. I had no idea what was coming next. He \nsat up on the bed and said, \"Sit here.\" I was thinking, \"He is going to ask me to give a lecture?\" I \nhad no idea. So I sat down and I didn't know what's next. I don't remember if there was a kirtan \nat the time but I remember feeling like I was the center of attention. I was thinking, \"What's \nSridhara Maharaja going to do?\" \n \nSridhara Maharaja turns to his servant, Mayapura dasa, and says, \"Mayapura, give me the Tiger \nBalm.\" Do you know what Tiger Balm is? He took the Tiger Balm in his hands and said, \"Look at \nme.\" He took the Tiger Balm and started to massage my forehead with it. He just kept on \nmassaging my forehead. It went on for some time. The devotees resumed the kirtan and he was \njust massaging my forehead.  \n \nMaharaja was thinking of my headache. That's a Vaisnava. How can you not love such a \nVaisnava. Here he was thinking of my headache. Such compassion. Absorbed in the holy name. \nDetermined to be in the association of devotees. This is the path we follow. We don't just have \nto go to Bhagavatam to find examples. We can find so many examples in our lives of devotees \nwho are determined to serve under all circumstances. \n \nAnother example...I was just in Boston. There's a godbrother there of mine whose name is \nMukta Vandya dasa. He's a very simple-hearted devotee. He's always engaged in service. He's \nhad two heart attacks. He had one heart attack when he was living in Gita Nagari. He used to \nsell flowers every day in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which is about an hour away from Gita \nNagari. He was married at the time. He worked very hard selling flowers, but he would use \npractically all of the money he earned for the temple. In fact, he was sleeping in a small tool \nshed filled with tools.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu wasn't thinking about accummulating money for himself. He was just \nthinking about how to accummulate money for Radha Damodara and serve the temple. He \nwould work very hard. He'd work so hard that one day he had a heart attack on his way to \nwork. Krsna arranged that he had the heart attack while driving right close to the home of a \nperson who was his auto mechanic. When his mechanic saw him, he immediately knew what \nwas happening and called the hospital. He then had to be airlifted by a helicopter and was \ntaken to another hospital. They saved him. They put whatever they had to put in him. I believe \n\nit was a stent or something like that to open up the blockage.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu gradually recovered and continued to work. He was working a little bit \neasier though. After some time, he got rid of his home when his wife moved elsewhere. So he \nstayed in the basement of the temple building in a little corner. He kept all of his belongings \nthere. He continued to work every day selling flowers and continued to give his profits to the \ntemple.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu always wore very simple clothing. The van he drove for his flower \nbusiness was not very fancy. Unfortunately he had a second heart attack. By that time I was \nalready telling him. \"Mukta, you've got to slow down. You need to take care of your body. It's \nKrsna's body. It's not your body.\" He's loved by so many devotees. He's just a simple-hearted \ndevotee who always just wants to serve. \n \nNow Mukta Vandya Prabhu lives in the Boston temple. He's careful now not to push himself too \nhard. But he's still ready to do any service that needs to be done. He's just fully engaged in \nservice. If somebody comes to the temple, he preaches to them. He has no formal position. He \nhas a little room on the second floor of the temple. Whenever guests come to the temple, they \nalways go to see Mukta. He's the friend of everybody.  \n \nIf there's nobody to give class, Mukta Vandya will go downstairs to give Bhagavad-gita class. If \nthere's nobody to cook the offering, Mukta Vandya will be the first person to run down and \ncook for Radha Gopivallabha. \n \nThe day before I left Boston, one had to leave for Croatia because his father passed away. There \nwas nobody to buy all of the bhoga for a big feast for a big ceremony the temple was having the \nnext day. I arrived at the temple and came through back door of the temple. Mukta Vandya was \nstanding there by a van full of bhoga. He had gone to purchase all the bhoga for the feast with \nanother devotee who went with him to help to carry all of it. There was nobody to buy it, \nMukta Vandya just went out to do it. \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu always goes and buys flowers for the deities. Everybody who knows him \nat the flower market loves him. Sometimes he's given thousands of dollars worth of flowers for \nfree. He's the friend of everybody. Ajata satru. He just wants to serve. He's careful. He doesn't \npush his body. He knows his limits. \n \nOnce every month for a few days he goes to serve Satsvarupa das Goswami. He took first \ninitiation from Srila Prabhpuada but second initiation from Satsvarupa das Goswami. So he goes \nthere just so that he can have an opportunity to serve.  \n \nI was telling the story the other night about Vaisnava Prema. Who was going to see Vaisnava \nPrema practically every day? Who took care of all of the arrangements for him? It was Mukta \nVandya. It was Mukta Vandya who told me the story which I shared with all of you the other \nday. When I asked Mukta Vandya, \"Is Vaisnava Prema in pain?\" He told me, \"I can't say for sure. \n\nWhen I was there two days ago, he was crying although he appeared to be asleep. He didn't \nknow I was there. He was speaking aloud though and was saying, \"How beautiful Vrndavana is.\" \nSo I don't know if he was crying from the pain or if he was crying because he was seeing the \nbeauty of Vrndavana.  \n \nIt was Mukta Vandya who made all of the arrangements after Vaisnava Prema departed. He \nalso visits another devotees whose name is Dina Dayal. He is currently in a nursing home. He \ngoes and brings him prasadam to him all of the time. Mukta Vandya lives for service.  \n \nWhy should we not meditate on such examples? Those who lives for service. This is good \nintelligence. This is the way to go back to Godhead. The way to go back to Godhead is to be \nabsorbed in service. Those who are absorbed in service are making the best preparation for \ngoing back to Godhead. When we think of them, we get strength, courage, enthusiasm and \nsatisfaction. We should be looking for such examples in our life. And, as Srila Prabhupada says \nin today's purport, which should look at their good decisions. This is parampara. This is what it \nmeans to follow in the footsteps of those who are teaching by their example how to make the \nright decisions to be engaged in devotional service.  \n \nHowever long they may have to live in this world, they'll continue living in this world \nperforming their duties. And to get both the fulfillment of their desires and good intelligence.  \n \nPrabhupada says, \"Good intelligence means to go back home, back to Godhead.\" This is what \nwe can learn from those who serve as examples. We should relish hearing about these \nexamples. These examples bring devotional service to life. It makes it real. It gives us a purpose \nfor living in this world. And it gives us a goal to achieve at the end of this life. \n \nThis is what Srila Prabhupada has instructed in this verse about the Pracetas. \n \nI'll read the verse again and then we will end.  \n \nThose who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence.\" \n \nI'm sorry I went a little bit late, but I hope the message was clear. Hare Krsna. \n \n ","attachment_name":"transcription_sb_4.30.10_english.pdf","attachment_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/sites/default/files/attachments/transcription_sb_4.30.10_english.pdf"},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"ru":{"title":"11 августа, 2018 - Ретрит учеников - Магдалиновка - Ш.Б. 4.30.10 - Английский/ Русский","event":"Retreat","topic":"Шримад Бхагаватам","translation":"Русский","location":"Magdalinivka","transcription":{"text":"","attachment_name":""},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"counters":{"audio_page_view":0,"audio_play_count":0,"downloads":"129","video_page_view":0,"en_transcription_view":0,"ru_transcription_view":0,"en_summary_view":0,"ru_summary_view":0}},{"uuid":"1f8bcffa-5bd8-42c3-b89d-081bfb0e3fe4","needs_translation":true,"created_date":"2018-08-26","published_date":"","author":"Niranjana Swami","part":"7","chapter":"15","verse":"45","download_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/download/33355","lecture_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/en/lecture/26495","duration":"01:37:59","downloads":"147","audio_link":"https://nrs-site.s3.amazonaws.com/lectures/2018/2018-08/niranjana_swami_-_sb_7.15.45_on_balarama-purnima_-c2a0almaty_26-aug-2018.mp3","soundCloud_link":"https://soundcloud.com/niranjana-swami/august-26-2018-almaty","youtube":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsg2S32qsdM?rel=gallery-all&wmode=opaque&autoplay=0"],"en":{"title":"August 26, 2018 - Almaty, Kazakhstan - Balarama Purnima Class - English/ Russian","event":"Festival","topic":"Srimad Bhagavatam","translation":"Russian","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"\n\nTranscription of a Lecture Given on Balarama Purnima, August 26, 2018, in Almaty, Kazakhstan\nThe following is a partially-edited lecture given in Almaty, Kazakhstan on Balarama Purnima, August \n26, 2018\nToday we are observing the appearance of Lord Balarama. I will first speak about, \"Who is Lord \nBalarama?.\" I will then speak on a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam in which Srila Prabhupada speaks \nabout the necessity of getting spiritual strength from Lord Balarama.\nLord Balarama is the first expansion of Lord Krsna called a svamsa expansion. There's very little \ndifference between Krsna and Balarama. They are both the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nSome of the differences are that is Krsna is blackish like the monsoon raincloud and Balarama is white.\nKrsna plays a flute and Balarama plays a buffalo horn. Sometimes Balarama carries a flute but most \noften He carries a buffalo horn in Vrndavana. Balarama sometimes carries a plow and club.\nBalarama manifested in Vrndavana as Krsna's elder brother. He first appeared in the womb of Devaki \nand later, by the arrangement of Yogamaya, He was transferred to the womb on Rohini. In Vrndavana, \nBalarama is known as Rohininandana, the son of Rohini.\nOutside of Vrndavana, Lord Balarama is manifest as Mula-sankarsana. Mula-sankarsana is the first \nexpansion coming from Lord Balarama. When Lord Balarama appeared in Vrndavana in the womb of \nRohini, this Mula-sankarsana became drawn to Him and appeared within Him. This is explained in \nGopal Campu. Just as Krsna never leaves Vrndavana, Balarama never leaves Vrndavana.\nFrom Lord Balarama manifests His plenary expansions beginning with Mula-sankarsana. As Mula-\nsankarsana, Balarama is manifest outside of Vrndavana in Mathura and Dwaraka.\nFrom Balarama also comes all living entities. Even the nitya-siddhas in the spiritual world, all of \nKrsna's devotees who are either in santa rasa, dasya rasa, sakyha rasa or vatsalya rasa are all coming \nfrom Lord Balarama. Vrndavana is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama. In fact, the whole \ndhama is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama.\nSo Balarama serves Krsna by providing all this for Krsna's pleasure in the spiritual world. Those in \nconjugal rasa, the gopis, are expansions coming from Srimati Radharani.\nIn this way, all of Krsna's eternal associates, Krsna parisada, are manifestations coming from either \nLord Balarama or Srimati Radharani in the spiritual world.\nMula-sankarsana further expands as Maha-sankarsana. As Maha-sankarsana He becomes the source of \nall of the living entities who are serving Krsna in Vaikuntha.\nWhen we say, \"From Lord Balarama comes\", it suggests that at one time, within time, the living entities\nmanifested from Lord Balarama. But we should know that being under the influence of material time, \nthese things are difficult to conceive in the material world.\n\nFor instance, Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita to Arjuna, \"Never was there a time when you did not exist, \nnever was there a time when all these kings assembled in the battlefield did not exist, never was there a \ntime when I did not exist, nor in the future will any of us cease to be.\" (BG 2.12)\nSo when we say that the living entities are all emanations or expansions coming from Lord Balarama, \nimmediately we have a tendency to think, \"Oh at some point in time, they manifested.\" However, they \nare all eternally manifest.\nJust as Krsna, as stated in Brahma Samhita, is beginningless. Lord Brahma says that Krsna is advaitam \nacyutam, anadim, ananta-rupam. He is nondual. His body is never subject to decay. He is the \nbeginning. He has no end. He is the source of everything. So beginningless means, never was there a \ntime when He did not exist.\nIn the same way, never was there a time when Lord Balarama did not exist. Never was there a time \nwhen all of Krsna's eternal associates did not exist, and the living entities, the jivas, never was there a \ntime when they did not exist. Krsna's energies are always existing simultaneously along with Krsna.\nJust like this material world goes through cycles. It's manifest, it stays for some time and then \nunmanifest. But this manifestation and unmanifestation is an eternal process without beginning or end.\nIf I give you a little time to think about it— just a little time. Never was there a time when Krsna, \nBalarama, the living entities did not exist. This cannot be understood by the limited mind. As long as \nwe are under the influence of time, it is very difficult to understand that which is existing in eternal \ntime.\nKrsna says \"the spiritual world is unmanifest, infallible, and it is the supreme destination. When one \ngoes there he never has to come back. \"When Krsna says that the spiritual world is unmanifest, does it \nmean that it doesn't exist? No. Never was there a time when it manifested. It's eternal. And Krsna says \nthat when one goes there, he never comes back. Tad dhama paramam mama. \"That is My supreme \nabode.\" (BG 8.21)\nSo, as we said, Balarama is the first expansion coming from Krsna. But when did Balarama expand \nfrom Krsna? And when did Maha-sankarsana, Mula-sankarsana expand from the original Balarama? \nAnd when from the Mula-sankarsana did Maha-sankarsana manifest in order to manifest the Vaikuntha \nplanets and all of Krsna's servants in the Vaikuntha planets who serve Him in His various forms? We \ncannot say when it happened. We only use those terms because we think in those terms. And we won't \nbe able to fully understand until we go beyond the influence of time ourselves. Those who are beyond \nthe influence of time, for them, time is ever-present. Krsna's pastimes and Balarama's pastimes in the \nspiritual world are eternally manifest.\nTime is also manifest in the spiritual world. But there it exists to assist Krsna and Balarama in Their \npastimes. There is no destructive feature of time in the spiritual world.\nEvery morning, Krsna, Balarama, and Their cowherd boyfriends after breakfast and milking the cows, \ngo out to the pastures. During the day when the sun is fully manifest in the sky, They along with the \ncowherd boys take shelter in the caves of Govardhana. As the sun continues to pass, later in the evening\nKrsna and Balarama with Their cowherd boyfriends and the cows, return to Gokula.\n\n2\nIn the spiritual world, time is manifest just to assist Krsna in His pastimes. But there is no destructive \nfeature of time as time destroys everything in the material world.\nKrsna tells Arjuna when He manifested the universal form, \"kalo 'smi loka-ksaya-krt pravrddho\", Time \nI am, the great destroyer of the worlds.\" (BG 11.32)\nSo when Krsna creates this material world, first He creates time. That's how creation takes place. \nOtherwise how could creation take place if there was no time? So when it's time for unmanifested \nmaterial elements to manifest as the external energy, time first appears.\nThen from Maha-sankarsana, as we said, in the spiritual world comes Karanadakasayi Visnu, who is \nalso a manifestation of Lord Balarama. And from Karandakasayi Visnu comes Garbodakasayi Visnu \nwho enters into each universe, which are generated from Karanadakasayi Visnu. And from \nGarbodakasayi Visnu who lies in the Garbodaka Ocean, comes the first created being in the universe, \nLord Brahma.\nThey are all expansions coming from Lord Balarama. Then there is Ksirodakasayi Visnu, who is also \nthe supersoul, manifested in the heart of all living beings. After the manifestation of Ksirodakasayi \nVisnu, comes Sesa who is a manifestation of the Lord who serves the Lord in various ways in this \nworld.\nAnanta-sesa, on each of His hoods, holds material universes. That's spiritual strength. Imagine holding \nunlimited universes on your hoods, and you standing on nothing? Try to conceive. It's inconceivable.\nSo Ananta-sea is holding all the universes on his different hoods but he rests on nothing. He is self-\nsufficient. And He is a manifestation of Lord Balarama.\nThere are two manifestations of Sesa. There's Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods, and \nthen there is the Ananta-sesa who is the bed of Lord Visnu. In the Laghu-bhagavatamrita Rupa \nGoswami explains that the Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods is an avesa avatara of \nLord Balarama. He is saktyavesa. He's an empowered jiva who holds the universe on his heads as \nAnanta-sesa.\nThe other manifestation of Sesa is a plenary expansion of Lord Balarama upon whom Lord Visnu lies.\nAnanta-sesa serves Lord Krsna, just as Lord Balarama is serving Lord Krsna in all of these different \nforms in the matter of creation and maintenance of this cosmic manifestation. Ananta-sesa is also \nmanifest as Krsna's pillow, Krsna's shoes, Krsna's bed, Krsna's sacred thread, Krsna's garments, etc.. In \nthis way, Ananta-sesa is rendering service to Krsna.\nSo Lord Balarama, in His different manifestations, is rendering service to Krsna in unlimited ways. \nEven though Lord Balarama is Krsna Himself, He is always absorbed in the mood of, \"I am Krsna's \nservant.\"\nLord Balarama's service mood towards Krsna is described as sankula, or mixed. He is Krsna's friend. \nKrsna goes out with his cowherd boyfriends. Lord Balarama is going with Him into the pasturing \n\ngrounds. He's Krsna's servant as we already described in various ways how Lord Balarama renders \nservice to Krsna. And He also has a mood of vatsalya, because He is Krsna's older brother.\nIn Vedic culture, ancient culture, the older brother is always worshipped and respected as one's \nsuperior. So Balarama also has this vatsalya mood of protecting Krsna.\nWhen Balarama and Krsna entered into the forest of Dhenukasura, Krsna spoke about Lord Balarama \nas follows:\n\"O greatest of Lords, just see how these trees are bowing their heads at Your lotus feet, which are \nworshipable by the immortal demigods. The trees are offering You their fruits and flowers to eradicate \nthe dark ignorance that has caused their birth as trees.\" (SB 10.15.5)\nSo Krsna is considering Balarama His superior. In the forest of Dhenukasura, Balarama is lying down \nwith His head on the lap of the cowherd boys and Krsna is taking Balarama's lotus feet and is \nmassaging them. So Balarama also serves Krsna in this vatsalya mood and is treated as a superior by \nKrsna. Balarama also serves Krsna in madhurya-rasa. But to do that, He is manifested as Ananga-\nmanjari, the sister of Radharani.\nBalarama is also considered Adi-guru. Adi-guru means the original guru. Just as Krsna treats Balarama \nas a superior, He also treats Him as guru. Balarama is akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda means unlimited. \nIn other words, Balarama is the guru that manifests in unlimited forms to serve as guru. And all gurus \nare understood to be representatives of Lord Balarama, who is the source of spiritual strength.\nPrabhupada explains in Krsna book. \"In the Upanisad it is stated, nayam atma bala-hinena labhyah. The\npurport is that one cannot attain the supreme platform of self-realization without being sufficiently \nfavored by Balarama. Bala does not mean physical strength. No one can attain spiritual perfection by \nphysical strength. One must have the spiritual strength which is infused by Balarama, or Sankarsana. \nAnanta, or Sesa, is the power which sustains all the planets in their different positions. Materially this \nsustaining power is known as the law of gravitation, but actually it is a display of the potency of \nSankarsana. Balarama, or Sankarsana, is spiritual power, or the original spiritual master. Therefore \nLord Nityananda Prabhu, who is also the incarnation of Balarama, is the original spiritual master. And \nthe spiritual master is the representative of Balarama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who \nsupplies spiritual strength. In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is confirmed that the spiritual master is the \nmanifestation of the mercy of Krsna.\" (Krsna Book Ch. 2)\nSo Prabhupada refers to the verse from the Mundaka Upanisad.\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvan\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nThis verse means, \"The Supreme Lord cannot be attained by one who has no spiritual strength, one \nwho is careless or wild, or whose austerites are inappropriate. The Lord appears before a person who \nstrives by the right means to attain Him. Such a person enters the spiritual world.\"\n\nOne requires spiritual strength in order to understand Krsna and to enter the spiritual world. \nPrabhupada says that we are not talking about physical strength. Spiritual strength is the strength to \novercome the influence of the modes of material nature, to cross the ocean of material existence, and to\nbecome qualified to enter into that supreme abode which is unmanifest and infallible.\nWho is the source of spiritual strength? It is Balarama who is akhanda guru tattva. He manifests \nHimself in various forms in order to give strength to the living entities in the material world so they can\nfind the determination, courage, and satisfaction to overcome the stringent laws of material nature and \nto achieve entrance into that eternal abode.\nAs the Mundaka Upanisad says, \"Krsna manifests Himself to that person who strives to achieve Him \nby the right means.\" What is the right means?\nThat is the verse we wanted to read today from Srimad Bhagavatam. This verse speaks about the right \nmeans to cross the ocean of material existence, by getting strength from the spiritual master and \npredecessor spiritual masters.\nHow can we overcome the illusory energy by our own strength? A devotee never thinks, \"I am \nspiritually strong by my own endeavors.\" He knows that whatever spiritual strength he has, has been \ngiven to him because he is taking shelter of spiritual strength.\nJust as one takes shelter of Krsna consciousness,\nkrsna -- surya-sama, maya haya andhakara\nyahan krsna, tahan nahi mayara adhikara\n\"Krsna is compared to sunshine, and maya is compared to darkness. Wherever there is sunshine, there \ncannot be darkness. As soon as one takes to Krsna consciousness, the darkness of illusion (the influence\nof the external energy) will immediately vanish. (Madhya 22.31)\nWherever there is Krsna, there cannot be maya. Wherever there is Krsna consciousness, there cannot be\nthe influence of illusion. But we cannot manifest Krsna before us by our own strength.\nSrimad Bhagavatam states:\nathapi te deva padambuja-dvaya-\nprasada-lesanugrhita eva hi\njanati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno\nna canya eko 'pi ciram vicinvan\nMy Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the \ngreatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years. (SB \n10.14.29)\nUnless one gets that drop of mercy he cannot understand.\n3\nKrsna tells Arjuna,\n\nMy dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before \nyou, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My \nunderstanding. (Bg 11.54)\nTherefore the knowledge and strength to cross over the material existence is coming from Krsna and \nBalarama. Balarama is Adi-guru, the original guru, He is the original source of all spiritual strength. If \none wishes to get spiritual strength, he must take shelter of guru and as this verse we are going to read \ntoday says, our predecessor gurus.\nSo this is the verse and purport that I am going to read in this connection. It's the 7th Canto of Srimad \nBhagavatam, 15th chapter, 45th verse.\nyavan nr-kaya-ratham atma-vasopakalpam\ndhatte garistha-caranarcanaya nisatam\njnanasim acyuta-balo dadhad asta-satruh\nsvananda-tusta upasanta idam vijahyat\nTRANSLATION\nAs long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and paraphernalia, which are \nnot fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, namely his spiritual \nmaster and the spiritual master's predecessors. By their mercy, one can sharpen the sword of \nknowledge, and with the power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's mercy one must then \nconquer the enemies mentioned above. In this way, the devotee should be able to merge into his \nown transcendental bliss, and then he may give up his body and resume his spiritual identity.\nThis verse refers to the enemies mentioned in the previous verse. So in order to more fully understand \nwhat this verse is talking about one should know what these enemies are. And this is the previous verse.\nIn the conditioned stage, one's conceptions of life are sometimes polluted by passion and \nignorance, which are exhibited by attachment, hostility, greed, lamentation, illusion, fear, \nmadness, false prestige, insults, fault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, \nbewilderment, hunger and sleep. All of these are enemies. Sometimes one's conceptions are also \npolluted by goodness. (SB 7.15.43–44)\nIs there anyone who thinks that these enemies that we've listed have all been conquered? I'll read them \none more time.\nAttachment. One by one. Hostility. Greed. Lamentation, illusion, fear, madness, false prestige, insult, \nfault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, bewilderment, hunger, sleep. All of these are \nenemies.\nBy the strength of our own intelligence, to some degree, we may be able to deal with some of these \nenemies. But Prabhupada is going to make the point very clear in the purport that simply by knowledge\nitself one cannot cut away from these enemies.\nKrsna says clearly that the living entities in the material world are struggling very hard with material \nexistence. None of us can say, \"I'm not struggling with these things.\".\n\nOftentimes devotees ask me how to deal with the fact that they are struggling with Krsna \nconsciousness. I say to them, \"You're struggling?! It's good that you're struggling. As soon as you stop \nstruggling you're finished.\" If we're struggling it means that we want to overcome these bad influences. \nThose who don't want to overcome them, think it's natural to be lusty. It's natural to be envious. They \ndon't think they are in illusion because they think illusion is reality.\nWe should therefore struggle to find the spiritual strength to overcome these enemies. That much \nstruggling we have to do. If we don't struggle for that, we'll have to struggle with material nature, \nwhich is very hard on the living entity, and causes so much anxiety.\nPrabhupada says that this material world is kuntha. It is a place of anxiety. It cannot be avoided. \nEverything in this world is temporary and the eternal living entity is going to have to be in anxiety \nabout losing that which he is attached to. So he struggles with this illusory energy.\nA devotee therefore prays. \"Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare/ Hare Rama Hare Rama \nRama Rama Hare Hare.\" He's praying to Krsna. He's praying to Lord Balarama. \"Please give me the \nstrength so that I may be engaged in Krsna's service.\" He's praying to Srimati Radharani. Please engage\nme in Krsna's service. He's looking for strength. This is his struggle.\nSo just as this verse states that \"As long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and\nparaphernalia, which are not fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, \nnamely his spiritual master and the spiritual master's predecessors.\"\nSo let me read the purport. Please take note of the emphasis Srila Prabhupada is making about strength.\nIt's a little bit long. Try to listen carefully.\nIn Bhagavad-gita (4.9) the Lord says:\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\" This is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\nIn other words, this is what it means to accept help from the superiors is to go back home, back to \nGodhead. This is the destination that Krsna wants all living entities to achieve. And Lord Balarama and\nthose in the line of Lord Balarama are meant to give us the strength to go back to the spiritual world.\nThis is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\n... to go back home, back to Godhead.\nIt is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.20.17):\nnr-deham adyam sulabham sudurlabham\nplavam sukalpam guru-karnadharam\n\nmayanukulena nabhasvateritam\npuman bhavabdhim na taret sa atma-ha\nThis human form of body is a most valuable boat, and the spiritual master is the captain, guru-\nkarnadharam, to guide the boat in plying across the ocean of nescience. The instruction of Krsna \nis a favorable breeze. One must use all these facilities to cross over the ocean of nescience. Since \nthe spiritual master is the captain, one must serve the spiritual master very sincerely so that by his\nmercy one will be able to get the mercy of the Supreme Lord.\nA significant word here is acyuta-balah. The spiritual master is certainly very merciful to his \ndisciples, and consequently by satisfying him a devotee gets strength from the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore says, guru-krsna-prasade paya \nbhakti-lata-bija: [Cc. Madhya 19.151] one must first please the spiritual master, and then one \nautomatically pleases Krsna and gets the strength with which to cross the ocean of nescience.\nThis is the point I was making before. Simply knowledge, is insufficient. One can study the Vedas for \nmillions of births, as Lord Brahma says in Brahma Samhita, and still never be able to understand \nKrsna. So it's not simply by knowledge that one can cross the ocean of material existence.\nThe purport continues:\nIf one seriously desires to return home, back to Godhead, one must therefore become strong \nenough by pleasing the spiritual master, for thus one gets the weapon with which to conquer the \nenemy, and one also gets the grace of Krsna. Simply getting the weapon of jnana is insufficient. \nOne must sharpen the weapon by serving the spiritual master and adhering to his instructions. \nThen the candidate will get the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nPrabhupada then gives a nice analogy.\nIn general warfare one must take help from his chariot and horses in order to conquer his enemy, \nand after conquering his enemies he may give up the chariot and its paraphernalia. Similarly, as \nlong as one has a human body, one should fully use it to obtain the highest perfection of life, \nnamely going back home, back to Godhead.\nUsing the human form of life to its full potential.\nkamasya nendriya-pritir\nlabho jiveta yavata\njivasya tattva-jijnasa\nnartho yas ceha karmabhih\nLife's desires should never be directed toward sense gratification. One should desire only a healthy life,\nor self-preservation, since a human being is meant for inquiry about the Absolute Truth. Nothing else \nshould be the goal of one's works. (SB 1.2.10)\nThe perfection of knowledge is certainly to become transcendentally situated (brahma-bhuta [SB \n4.30.20]). As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):\n\nbrahma-bhutah prasannatma\nna socati na kanksati\nsamah sarvesu bhutesu\nmad-bhaktim labhate param\n\"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully \njoyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living \nentities. In that state he attains pure devotional service.\" Simply by cultivating knowledge as the \nimpersonalists do, one cannot get out of the clutches of maya. One must attain the platform of \nbhakti.\nbhaktya mam abhijanati\nyavan yas casmi tattvatah\ntato mam tattvato jnatva\nvisate tad-anantaram\n\"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one \nis in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of \nGod.\" (Bg. 18.55) Unless one has attained the stage of devotional service and the mercy of the \nspiritual master and Krsna, there is a possibility that one may fall down and again accept a \nmaterial body. Therefore Krsna stresses in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\"\nThe word tattvatah, meaning \"in reality,\" is very important. Tato mam tattvato jnatva. Unless one \nunderstands Krsna in truth by the mercy of the spiritual master, one is not free to give up his \nmaterial body.\nIn other words, one has to accept another material body.\n4\nAs it is said, aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah: [SB \n10.2.32] if one neglects to serve the lotus feet of Krsna, one cannot become free from the material\nclutches simply by knowledge. Even if one attains the stage of brahma-padam, merging in \nBrahman, without bhakti he is prone to fall down. One must be very careful in regard to the \ndanger of falling down again into material bondage. The only insurance is to come to the stage of \nbhakti, from which one is sure not to fall. Then one is free from the activities of the material \nworld. In summary, as stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, one must get in touch with a bona fide\nspiritual master coming in the parampara of Krsna consciousness, for by his mercy and \n\ninstructions one is able to get strength from Krsna. Thus one engages in devotional service and \nattains the ultimate goal of life, the lotus feet of Visnu.\nSignificant in this verse are the words jnanasim acyuta-balah. Jnanasim, the sword of knowledge, \nis given by Krsna, and when one serves the guru and Krsna in order to hold the sword of Krsna's \ninstructions, Balarama gives one strength. Balarama is Nityananda. Vrajendra-nandana yei, saci-\nsuta haila sei, balarama ha-ila nitai. This bala -- Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya \nMahaprabhu, and both of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take \nshelter of Their lotus feet. They come especially to deliver the fallen souls of this age, papi tapi \nyata chila, hari-name uddharila. Their weapon is sankirtana, hari-nama. Thus one should accept \nthe sword of knowledge from Krsna and be strong with the mercy of Balarama. We are therefore \nworshiping Krsna-Balarama in Vrndavana. In the Mundaka Upanisad (3.2.4) it is said:\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvams\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nOne cannot attain the goal of life without the mercy of Balarama. Sri Narottama dasa Thakura \ntherefore says, nitaiyera karuna habe, vraje radha-krsna pabe: when one receives the mercy of \nBalarama, Nityananda, one can attain the lotus feet of Radha and Krsna very easily.\nse sambandha nahi yara,   \nbrtha janma gela tara,\nvidya-kule hi karibe tara\nIf one has no connection with Nitai, Balarama, then even though one is a very learned scholar or \njnani or has taken birth in a very respectable family, these assets will not help him. We must \ntherefore conquer the enemies of Krsna consciousness with the strength received from Balarama. \n[end of purport]\nThese enemies are like whips. They are beating us again and again, keeping us in the bodily \nidentification. Imagine living with enemies. We are living with enemies right in our own bodies.\nKrsna described the enemy as lust. When Arjuna asked Krsna, \"What is it Krsna that compels a person \nto act even against his own will?\" Krsna replied that \"It's lust only Arjuna which is later transformed in \nanger, which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world.\" How to conquer this enemy on our own \nstrength?\nThose who try to do it on the strength of their own intelligence,\ntvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\n (SB 10.2.32)\n\n[...]their intelligence is impure. They fall down from their position of imagined superiority because \nthey have no regard for Your lotus feet.\nThey are destined to fall, because they haven't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus feet. They haven't taken \nshelter of Lord Balarama. They haven't taken shelter of bhakti, which manifests through the mercy of \nthe spiritual and the predecessor spiritual masters.\nThe spiritual master must represent the predecessor spiritual masters. Only by representing the \npredecessor spiritual master can one strive to achieve the Lord by the right means.\nThe verse nayam atma bala hinena labhyo clearly states that one has to achieve the Lord by the right \nmeans. One should not be wild or careless. By the right means Krsna reveals Himself and one enters \nthe spiritual world.\n5\nThis is the meaning of akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda guru tattva means that Lord Balarama manifests \nHimself as guru in an unlimited variety of forms. And it is the service of guru to give one the strength \nto cross over the ocean of material existence to enter into the spiritual world.\nSo this is how we worship Lord Balarama on His appearance day. We should know that He is adi-guru. \nHe is the original guru and and all other gurus represent Him. Without His mercy, without taking \nshelter of Him, we will never be able to give up this sense gratification and attachment to the material \nworld.\nAs described in the song Gauranga Bolite Ha'be, Narottama das Thakur is praying.\nara kabe nitai-candera karuna karibe\nsamsara-vasana mora kabe tuccha habe\n\"When will Lord Nityananda have mercy upon me so that I can realize the uselessness of material \npleasure?'\nHe is praying in that way. Who is Nityananda? He is Lord Balarama. Nityananda is the same as Lord \nBalarama. He has appeared to serve Lord Caitanya in the same way as Lord Balarama has appeared to \nserve Lord Krsna.\nAnd as Prabhupada says in today's purport, \"Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and \nboth of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take shelter of Their lotus \nfeet.\"\nWhat is their weapon?\nkrsna-varnam tvisakrsnam\nsangopangastra-parsadam\nSB 11.5.32\nThe verse describes how Lord Caitanya appears with His weapons. What is Lord Caitanya's weapon? \nHe's not coming to chop off heads. Not coming with a club to beat and destroy. He's coming with the \nweapon of harinama sankirtan. That is the weapon He has come with in this age of Kali.\n\nSrila Bhaktisiddhanti Sarasvati Thakur describes in one article of the Harmonist Magazine.\n\"Nityananda alone possesses the distinctive function of the guru. In Nityananda the function is \nembodied. Nityananda is the servant-God. He serves Sri Gaurasundara by the distinctive method of \nreverential servitude. He is identical with Sri Balarama of krsna-lila.[...]\n[...]\"But Nityananda does not directly instruct in the confidential service of Krsna. Srimati Radhika is \nthe guru of the inner circle of the servants of Krsna. Srimati Radhika, however, accepts the offer of \nservice of only those souls who are specially favored by Nityananda and are deemed by Him to be fit \nfor Her service.\nSo in all respects we are dependent upon the mercy of Nityananda Balarama to become qualifided to \ndance in the spiritual world and to be fully engaged in loving devotional service to the Lord.\nThis is the goal. Prabhupada clearly states this right from the outset of the verse. The goal is to go back \nhome, back to Godhead. The goal is not to be happy in this material world.\nThe devotee who understands this goal may become happy in this world. But as Rupa Goswami says, \nthere is three types of happiness. 1) Happiness derived from sense gratification, which is temporary. 2) \nHappiness which comes from liberation, which can also be temporary.\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\nOne will fall down from his position of imagined superiority if he hasn't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus \nfeet. And 3) The happiness which comes from bhakti, by realizing\njivera 'svarupa' haya -- krsnera 'nitya-dasa'\nI am Krsna's eternal servant, and my only business in life is to find shelter at His lotus feet. This is real \nhappiness.\nBy the mercy of guru, by the mercy of predecessor gurus, and by the mercy of Lord Balarama. This is \nwhat it means to take shelter. And this is why we observe Lord Balarama's appearance day... to pray for\nthis strength.\nHare Krsna","attachment_name":"balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf","attachment_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/sites/default/files/attachments/balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf"},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"ru":{"title":"26 августа, 2018 - Алматы, Казахстан - Лекция на Баларама Пурниме - Английский/ Русский","event":"Festival","topic":"Шримад Бхагаватам","translation":"Русский","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"","attachment_name":""},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"counters":{"audio_page_view":0,"audio_play_count":0,"downloads":"147","video_page_view":0,"en_transcription_view":0,"ru_transcription_view":0,"en_summary_view":0,"ru_summary_view":0}},{"uuid":"eb9ba9ea-4a8e-4ab5-9a58-03009d5e764e","needs_translation":true,"created_date":"2018-08-11","published_date":"","author":"Niranjana Swami","part":"4","chapter":"30","verse":"10","download_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/download/33333","lecture_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/en/lecture/26394","duration":"01:56:48","downloads":"129","audio_link":"https://nrs-site.s3.amazonaws.com/lectures/2018/2018-08/2018.08.11_e.s.nirandzhana_svami._shb-4.30.10_retrit.magdalinovka-lower_compression.mp3","soundCloud_link":"https://soundcloud.com/niranjana-swami/august-11-2013-disciple","youtube":"","en":{"title":"August 11, 2018 - Disciple Retreat - Magdalinivka - SB 4.30.10 - English/ Russian","event":"Retreat","topic":"Srimad Bhagavatam","translation":"Russian","location":"Magdalinivka","transcription":{"text":"\n\nAugust 11, 2018 – Disciple Retreat in Magdalinivka – SB 4.30.10 \n \nThe following is a partially-edited transcription of a lecture given on August 11, 2018, at the \nDisciple Retreat in Magdalinivka, Ukraine: \n \n \nye tu mam rudra-gitena \nsayam pratah samahitah \nstuvanty aham kama-varan \ndasye prajnam ca sobhanam \n \nTRANSLATION \nThose who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence. \n \nPURPORT \nGood intelligence means going back home, back to Godhead. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita \n(10.10): \n \ntesam satata-yuktanam \nbhajatam priti-purvakam \ndadami buddhi-yogam tam \nyena mam upayanti te \n \n\"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by \nwhich they can come to Me.\" \n \nOne who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know that the highest \nperfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this verse it is \nindicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracetas, the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is \nthe way of the parampara system. If we follow the acaryas, we attain the same benefit as our \npredecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly \nhearing Bhagavad-gita from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no difference \nbetween hearing Bhagavad-gita directly from the Supreme Lord and following a personality like \nArjuna, who formerly heard Bhagavad-gita directly from the Lord. Sometimes foolish people \nargue that since Krsna is not present at the moment, one cannot take direct instructions from \nHim. Such foolish people do not know that there is no difference between directly hearing \nBhagavad-gita and reading it, as long as one accepts Bhagavad-gita as it is, spoken by the Lord. \nHowever, if one wants to understand Bhagavad-gita by his imperfect interpretations, one \ncannot possibly understand the mysteries of Bhagavad-gita, even though one may be a great \n\nscholar according to mundane estimation. \n \nNiranjana Swami: \n \nI'd like to put this verse a little bit into context before we speak about the purport Srila \nPrabhupada gave on the verse.  \n \nThis verse is spoken about the Pracetas, the sons of King Pracinabarhisat. King Pracinabarhisat \nbecame known as a Prajapati entrusted with the responsibility to create progeny. He had ten \nsons. He instructed his sons to prepare for householder life which for them meant to perform \nausterities for 10,000 years.  \n \nWhile traveling west to execute their father's order, they come upon a big lake, so big that it \nlooked like an ocean. They became captivated by the beautiful appearance of this lake. All of a \nsudden, they heard the sounds of drums, kettledrums and other instruments being played. The \nsounds were coming from within the lake. Just then, appearing from within the lake appeared \nLord Siva. Lord Siva came to them because he understood them to be highly qualified persons.  \n \nAn interesting point which I noticed when I was looking at these verses this morning is that Lord \nSiva was also attracted to the Pracetas because they were dedicated to following the order of \ntheir father. Prabhupada said in the purport that because they were surrendered to following \nthat order, Lord Siva saw the Pracetas as highly qualified persons and therefore he wanted to \ngive His association to them.  \n \nI bring this point up because yesterday we were talking about Dhruva Maharaja who was fixed \non the order of his mother. His mother requested him to follow the recommendations of his \nstepmother Suruci... to go to the forest to seek out the Supreme Lord, again, for the fulfillment \nof his desire. That point is made today in this verse also. By offering this prayer given by Lord \nSiva, the Lord told the Pracetas, \"they can both fulfill their desires and attain good intelligence.\" \n \nDhruva Maharaja went to the forest to seek out the Supreme Lord because he also wanted the \nfulfillment of his desires. We didn't speak that much on that point yesterday, but we know what \nhis desires were.  \n \nDhruva Maharaja was insulted and wanted revenge. He wanted to get a kingdom better than \nhis father's, grandfather's and great-grandfather's. He was so fixed on his mother's instructions \nthat when Narada Muni, who saw Dhruva Maharaja as a good candidate just as Lord Siva saw \nthe Pracetas as good candidates, gave Dhruva Maharaja instructions to return home, Dhruva \nMaharaja was more intent on going to the forest to obtain the darshan of the Supreme Lord. He \nhad desires he wanted fulfilled from Him.  \n \nNarada Muni tested Dhruva by instructing him, \"Just become equipoised, be self-satisfied. Do \nnot be disturbed by these things you are feeling in your heart, The forest is no place for a young \nboy like you. You're too young for such austerities. Wait until you are older.\", Dhruva Maharaja \n\nwas nonetheless fixed. \"No I have to seek out the Supreme Lord. I was told by my mother that \nHe can take care of everything for me. Sorry I know those are good instructions, but they don't \ntouch my heart. I've got something else on my mind. \n \nDhruva was fixed. \"I was told by my mother that the Lord will take care of my desires. She told \nme to go to the forest and you're telling me, 'Don't go to the forest.'\"  \n \nNarada Muni, an expert judge of time, place, and circumstances, then adjusted everything. He \nstill saw Dhruva as a good candidate and gave him instructions how he could get his desires \nfulfilled.  \n \nInterestingly, because it's similar to what we are going to hear about the Pracetas, Narada Muni \nalso gave Dhruva Maharaja a mantra to chant. He told him, \"If you chant this mantra you will be \nblessed by the Lord according to your desire.\" Srila Prabhupada explained in one purport in that \nsection about Dhruva Maharaja, that Dhruva Maharaja was initiated in the Visnu-mantra and \nwas given the mantra \"om namo bhagavate vasudevaya.\" \n \nIn the pastime with the Pracetas, the Pracetas had an order from their father. They were strictly \nfollowing his order, Lord Siva appeared to them, saw them as highly qualified persons, and told \nthem that because they were so qualified, he wanted to give them a mantra, or stotra, to \nchant. He told them that by chanting this mantra, \"...you will certainly achieve all your desired \nobjectives without fail.\" SB 4.24.79 \n \nIn connection to this point, I wanted to read a few verses from a previous chapter,  \n \n\"Although rendering devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and worshiping \nHim are very difficult, if one vibrates or simply reads this stotra [prayer] composed and sung by \nme [Lord Siva], he will very easily be able to invoke the mercy of the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead.\" (SB 4.24.76) \n \n\"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the dearmost objective of all auspicious benedictions. \nA human being who sings this song sung by me can please the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead. Such a devotee, being fixed in the Lord's devotional service, can acquire whatever he \nwants from the Supreme Lord. (SB 4.24.77) \n \nIn other words, Lord Siva is telling them, \"You can get whatever you desire to accomplish. \nWorship the Lord and get the fulfillment of your desire.\"  \n \nAnd in today's verse, after gaining darshan of the Lord, the Lord told the Pracetas,  \n \n\"Those who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence.\" (SB 4.30.10 \n \n\nAnd what did Prabhupada say in the purport today? What is good intelligence? Anyone \nremember what Prabhupada said? Yes...to go back to Godhead. That is good intelligence. He \nquotes the verse,  \n \ntesam satata-yuktanam \nbhajatam priti-purvakam \ndadami buddhi-yogam tam \nyena mam upayanti te \n \n\"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by \nwhich they can come to Me.\" (BG 10.10) \n \nThis is good intelligence. One gets the fulfillment of his desires and goes back to Godhead.  \n \nDhruva Maharaja got the fulfillment of his desires. However, in this case, when the Lord \nappeared to Dhruva and revealed all the desires that He would fulfill for him, Dhruva Maharaja \nwas completely distressed.  \n \nSomeone might ask, \"Why was he distressed? He got the fulfillment of his desires.\" But \nVisvanath Cakravarti Thakur explains that Dhruva Maharaja was distressed because the Lord \nfulfilled his previous desires. And after getting the darshan of the Lord, he realized that those \nprevious desires were so paltry, so petty. \n \nWhat were his previous desires? He wanted revenge. He wanted a kingdom. When the Lord \nappeared before Dhruva Maharaja, He told Dhruva Maharaja, \"You will get your father's throne \nand you will rule your father's kingdom for 36,000 years.\" That's what Dhruva wanted. He was \npreviously thinking, \"I couldn't sit on my father's lap. I want to be able to sit on the throne.\" But \nhe wanted something even greater than that. We'll get to that.  \n \nBut the first thing the Lord said was that \"You will rule the kingdom for 36,000 years. You will \nperform sacrifices. But you will remember Me. There will be no obstacles in your service as \nKing. You will remember the goal of your sacrifices.\" \n \nThe Lord detailed how Dhruva will rule his father's kingdom. After that, he will have a kingdom \neven better than Lord Brahma's. He will have his own planet, the polestar within this universe. \nWhen all planets in this universe are destroyed at the time of universal devastation, the \npolestar will remain. So ultimately he would rule a kingdom even better than Lord Brahma's.  \n \nIn addition, the Lord also told Dhruva, \"Your stepbrother will go to the forest to hunt and he will \nbe killed. Your stepmother, when she hears that her son has been killed in the forest, out of \ngreat despair, she will enter into the forest to look for her son and she will be devoured by a \nforest fire.\"  \n \nThese points were spoken directly to Dhruva by the Lord. And then the Lord departed.  \n\n \nAlthough Dhruva got the fulfillment of his desires, he was lamenting. \"What is the value of \nthose desires in relation to what I just experienced in the darshan of the Lord?\"  \n \nAdditionally, when the Lord appeared to Dhruva, Dhruva became so overwhelmed, he offered \nprayers to glorify the Lord. In those prayers which he personally composed, he asked for only \none benediction from the Lord. \"Please let me always be in the association of Your devotees.\" \n \nHowever, the Lord departed without saying anything about his new request. Visvanath \nCakravarti Thakur explains that that was the reason why Dhruva Maharaja was thrown into \nlamentation even though he got the darshan of the Lord. Dhruva realized that, \"The Lord \nfulfilled all of my previous desires, but He didn't respond to what I said when I saw Him.\" \nDhruva was therefore condemning himself, saying, \"I have prayed only for useless things. My \nactivities were exactly like treatment given to a person who is already dead.\" (SB 4.9.34) \n \nAnyway, Dhruva Maharaja received the fulfilment of his desires. After ruling his father's \nkingdom for 36,000 years, when it was time for him to go to his next destination, a flower \nairplane descended from Vaikuntha. Death personified appeared before him. Death personified \nis a very fearful personality to behold. Most living beings do not know how to deal with this \npersonality. But what did Dhruva Maharaja do? He stepped on the head of death personified \nand used his head as a step to get into the flower airplane to go back to Godhead. \n \nIn this connection, Narada Muni gives the analogy how lightning and illumination appear \nsimultaneously. Death is also like that for those who are fully absorbed in thinking of Krsna. This \nis how important it is to be engaged fully in devotional service. In that state of consciousness, \none is prepared to meet death personified. The transition becomes easier for a devotee fully \nengaged in devotional service.  \n \nIn summary, Dhruva Maharaja got the fulfillment of his desires. Because he worshipped the \nLord and faithfully chanted the mantra given to him by Narada Muni, he ultimately went back \nto Godhead. \n \nLord Siva is telling the Pracetas the same thing, \"Chant this prayer I've given to you, be fixed in \ndevotional service, and one can acquire whatever he wants from the Lord.\" \n \nIn an earlier chapter, it is stated,  \n \n\"A devotee who rises early in the morning and with folded hands chants these prayers sung by \nLord Siva and gives facility to others to hear them certainly becomes free from all bondage to \nfruitive activities.\" (SB 4.24.78) \n \n\"My dear sons of the King, the prayers I have recited to you are meant for pleasing the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead, the Supersoul. I advise you to recite these prayers, which are as \neffective as great austerities.\" (SB 4.24.79) \n\n \nThe Pracetas, received and accepted these prayers. They then performed austerities for 10,000 \nyears while meditating on these prayers that were given to them by Lord Siva. \n \nAfter performing their austerities and chanting this prayer, the Lord appeared to the Pracetas. \nThe Lord, being very pleased by their austerities, spoke an often-quoted verse expressing His \npleasure with the Pracetas' austerities.  \n \n\"The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear sons of the King, I am very much pleased \nby the friendly relationships among you. All of you are engaged in one occupation -- devotional \nservice. I am so pleased with your mutual friendship that I wish you all good fortune. Now you \nmay ask a benediction of Me.\" (SB 4.30.8) \n \nThis is the verse where Srila Prabhupada speaks about unity in devotional service in his purport.  \n \n\"The Lord continued: Those who remember you every evening of every day will become \nfriendly with their brothers and with all other living entities. (SB 4.30.9) \n \nThe Pracetas also offered prayers to the Lord. This is proper... to begin with glorification. We \nshould not just ask for the fulfillment of our desires. Neither does a devotee think, \"If I glorify \nthe Lord I'll get a better chance of getting my desire fulfilled.\" A devotee glorifies the Lord \nbecause he has understood the true glories of the Lord, and therefore he glorifies the Lord's \nqualities, His beauty, His characteristics, His dealings with devotees, His opulences, etc..  \n \nIn addition, in their prayers, the Pracetas requested, ...\"we pray that You will be satisfied with \nus. That is our benediction. We do not desire anything other than Your full satisfaction.\" (SB \n4.30.30) \n \nAnd their other request was: \n \n\"Dear Lord, as long as we have to remain within this material world due to our material \ncontamination and wander from one type of body to another and from one planet to another, \nwe pray that we may associate with those who are engaged in discussing Your pastimes. We \npray for this benediction life after life, in different bodily forms and on different planets.\" (SB \n4.30.33) \n \nWhy do we read, again and again, that devotees who are in the presence of the Lord, pray, \"Let \nme have the association of Your devotees?\" There must be a certain special quality of devotees \nthat inspires devotees to ask the Lord, \"Let me be in the association of Your devotees.\" \n \nThe devotee thinks, \"If I could be in the association of devotees who are always glorifying You, \nthen I'm protected. I'll never be able to forget You.\" That is what a devotee wants. Under all \ncircumstances, he wants to be able to remember the Lord. A devotee thinks, \"If I'm in the \nassociation of devotees who are always glorifying You, how can I forget You?\" \n\n \nThere are so many verses which give emphasis to the value of devotee association. \nIn fact it was Narada Muni who said to King Pracinibarhisat, the father of the Pracetas:  \n \n\"My dear King, in the place where pure devotees live, following the rules and regulations and \nthus purely conscious and engaged with great eagerness in hearing and chanting the glories of \nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, in that place if one gets a chance to hear their constant \nflow of nectar, which is exactly like the waves of a river, one will forget the necessities of life -- \nnamely hunger and thirst -- and become immune to all kinds of fear, lamentation and illusion.\" \n(SB 4.29.39–40) \n \nNarada Muni was giving King Pracinabarhisat good instruction. When Narada Muni first visited \nthe king he was trying to get him to give up his attachment to fruitive activities. He told the \nallegorical story of King Puranjana in an attempt to convince him to give up his attachments. \nAfter hearing about Puranjana and then receiving further instruction from Narada Muni, the \nKing achieved liberation and then the story of King Pracinabarhisat was finished. Vidura then \nasked Maitreya, \"Can you go back to the Pracetas? What happened to them? What did they \nachieve?\" \n \nSo as we were explaining before, the Pracetas got the darshan of the Lord. The Lord asked them \nfor a benediction and their only requests were, \"We ask that you be satisfied by our devotional \nservice and that we have the association of devotees.\" \n \nLet us remember, however, that they were performing austerities under the request of their \nfather who told them to prepare for householder life. So they wanted to fulfill the desire of \ntheir father. So what did the Lord tell them? He said that, \"Because you are all united in \ndevotional service, you will all have your own kingdoms.\" \n \nImagine, each of them having their own kingdoms with no quarreling amongst themselves. The \nLord said, \"You will always have friendly relationships with your brothers and friendly \nrelationships towards all living entities.\" And then He told them, \"You will rule those kingdoms \nfor one million years.\" A million years! Of course, it's a million of our years. In celestial years, it \nwould be less. \n \nAs the Lord told Prahlada Maharaja, He similarly told the Pracetas, \"You will always be engaged \nin sacrifice. I'll be satisfied by your sacrifices so that you will not forget the actual goal.\" \n \nSometimes one may think that, \"Once one gets the darshan of the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead one soon goes back to Godhead.\" It's like the happy ending of the story. He gets the \ndarshan of the Lord and then goes back to Godhead. But here we see in the case of Dhruva \nMaharaja, he remained, reigning over his father's kingdom for 36,000 years. With the \nPracetas... they were ruling over their kingdoms for one million years. But they would perform \ntheir duties in this world without forgetting the Lord.  \n \n\nThat is what Prabhupada explained in his purports, that we perform our duties in this world, we \ntake the mantra which has been given to us, we chant that mantra, obtaining the association of \nthe Lord, and then after performing our duties in this world perfectly in Krsna consciousness, \nwe go back to Godhead.  \n \nIt's how we are supposed to live in this world. It's not that we are all just going to chant and \nwait for the Lord to appear to deliver us. No. We must understand how to perform our duties in \nthis world, especially those duties which have been entrusted to us and take the mantra which \nhas been given to us.  \n \nSrila Prabhupada compared the mantra given to the Pracetas by Lord Siva to receiving the Hare \nKrsna mantra. By performing our duties in Krsna consciousness while chanting the Hare Krsna \nmahamantra, at the appropriate time, all perfection will be there.  \n \nThe point that Srila Prabhupada makes in today's purport is that we should follow the decisions \nmade by those persons who received instructions from the Lord. Following their decisions is as \ngood as receiving instructions from the Lord.  \n \nPrabhupada says, \"One who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know \nthat the highest perfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this \nverse it is indicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracetas, the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is \nthe way of the parampara system. If we follow the acaryas, we attain the same benefit as our \npredecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly \nhearing Bhagavad-gita from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. (SB 4.30.10 Purport) \n \nOne follows the decisions of Arjuna. In other words, by having examples to follow we get \nstrength, courage, enthusiasm and determination to continue to execute our duties in this life.  \n \nWe oftentimes quote Sri Bhaktyaloka. We referred to that quote yesterday.  \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur explains: \n \n\"After receiving initiation and instructions from a bona fide guru, a fortunate disciple should \nfollow the path of the previous sadhus. Those who are proud neglect the previous mahajanas \nand create new paths. As a result, they soon proceed on their inauspicious path and ruin \nthemselves. It is said in the Skanda Purana: \n \nsa mrgyah sreyasam hetuh \npanthah santapa-varjitah \nanavapta-sramam purve \nyena santah pratasthire \n \n\n\"One should strictly follow the easy path which the previous mahajanas have accepted. That \npath bestows great auspiciousness and is devoid of all misery.\" (Sri Bhaktyaloka, Chapter 10) \n  \nWe speak on this point a lot. Actually this is the point I was asked to speak on today. I am just \ngetting to it now. But it's all connected. It's connected to Dhruva Maharaja, it's connected to \nthe Pracetas, it's connected to Haridas Thakur about whom Bhaktivinode Thakur speaks. He \nsays that we have to have examples, our mahajanas, from whom we take shelter. We must try \nto remember their activities and to remember their decisions in order to get strength. \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur continues,  \n \n\"By discussing the path of the previous sadhus, one gets determination, courage, and \nsatisfaction. \n \nWho does Bhaktivinode Thakur use as an example? He uses the example of Haridas Thakur. \nHaridas Thakur's path wasn't such an easy path to follow. But Bhaktivinode Thakur says that by \nremembering his path it becomes easy.  \n \nDoes that mean that we have to beaten through twenty-two marketplaces? Do we have to be \nthreatened to be killed? Persecuted? Haridas Thakur was subjected to so much. He was \ndragged to prison and threatened by the Kazi. He was told to give up his convictions and to stop \nchanting the holy names. Haridas Thakur's response was, \"You can cut my body to pieces but I \nwill never give up chanting the holy name of the Lord.\" \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur explains that Haridas Thakur taught by his example three very important \nprinciples to be followed by those who follow in the footsteps of previous sadhus. The first, is \nthat one must always be determined, in all circumstances, that \"Yes. I must be determined to \nexecute my duties in this world while remembering the Lord.  \n \nThe second is to never give up the chanting of Hare Krishna.  \n \nThe third principle is to be compassionate towards all other living beings. \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur says that this is the path given by our previous acaryas which must be \nfollowed. It's the easy path. What makes it the easy path to follow? Austerities for 10,000 years \nunder the water? This is the easy path to follow? To go to the forest to eat berries and dried   \nleaves, to then give up all eating, by living off breath alone? To perform severe austerities \nstanding on one toe? This is the easy path? To be threatened, to be beaten in twenty-two \nmarketplaces until death? This is the easy path I'm supposed to follow? \n \nBy remembering them or by following their decisions, whatever difficulties or obstacles we \nneed to overcome become easier for us to surrender. Without an example it's very difficult to \ndo something on our own. \n \n\nTherefore Bhaktivinode Thakur says that those who are proud create their own paths.  \n \n\"Those who are proud neglect the previous mahajanas and create new paths. As a result, they \nsoon proceed on their inauspicious path and ruin themselves.\" (Sri Bhaktyaloka, Chapter 10) \n \nIn other words, they have no one to follow for spiritual strength.  \n \nWe accept the path established by our mahajanas as our examples to follow. By remembering \nthem, whatever difficulties we have to undergo become easier. In comparison to them, our \nausterities are small. We make ourselves think that they are just so big, so difficult, impossible \nto overcome. \"How can I ever do it? This is too much.\" \n \nBut by remembering those who made good decisions and who showed by their example how \nthey crossed the ocean of material existence and went back home, back to Godhead, we get \nstrength, courage, determination and enthusiasm. It makes it easier. That's how it becomes the \neasy path. \n \nIn this regard, I've been telling devotees recently a very practical story I experienced. It means a \nlot to me. It moves my heart. It's what gave me strength. I'm sure that many have heard this \nstory, but I'll tell it again. I love telling it.  \n \nSarvajna dasa: About Sridhara Maharaja?  \n \nYes Sridhara Maharaja. It's such a perfect example. By remembering Sridhara Maharaja, I got \nstrength. We had a previous friendly relationship with each other before he came to Mayapura \nin 2004. When Sridhara Maharaja came to Mayapura, he understood he would soon be leaving \nthis world. He had two desires he wanted fulfilled before departing. He wanted to go to \nMayapura to take part in the installation of Panca Tattva and he wanted to be with his \ngodbrothers.  \n \nHe expressed those desires when he was told by Canadian doctors that he couldn't receive a \nliver transplant because the cancer had spread too far in his body. From Canada, he met \nIndradyumna Maharaja in London and then the two of them came together to Mayapura.  \n \nSridhara Maharaja liked my kirtans. One time when Sridhara Maharaja was staying in a \ndevotee's flat near Bhaktivedanta Hospital at the same time I was being treated in \nBhaktivedanta Hospital, Sridhara Maharaja called me and asked, \"Maharaja can you come over \nand chant with me?\" He was not terminally ill at that time. But he was having a lot of health \nproblems. He was staying in an apartment trying to recover from an earlier treatment.  \n \nSo as soon as I had an opportunity I went over and visited Maharaja. When I arrived I expressed \nhow happy I was to see him. The first thing he said to me was, \"You see that harmonium over \nthere? Can we chant?\" It was just myself and Sridhara Maharaja. The two of us just sat and had \nkirtan together. \n\n \nAnother time when he was in Bombay, Maharaja asked again if I could come. But I couldn't go \nthat time. I believe he was again staying someplace near the hospital in Bombay but I was in \nPune at the Pune Yatra. From Pune I had to immediately go someplace else. So I asked \nMaharaja to forgive me. I told him I couldn't come that time but next time I would definitely \nmake the time to visit and chant together with him. \n \nThe next time I saw Maharaja was in Mayapura. A large group of devotees assembled to receive \nhim. It was a wonderful reception. There's a little funny story in this connection. When \nMaharaja arrived he had all this red around his mouth. It looked like it was blood. When the \ndevotees saw him they were shocked, but nobody wanted to say anything. They came down \nand sat in the room with Sridhara Maharaja who then said, \"I was eating red candy.\"  \n \nAnyway, when I saw Sridhara Maharaja, I embraced him and I said, \"Sridhara Maharaja I'm just \nso happy to see you.\" One of Maharaja's desires was also to have was kirtan in his room every \nnight. So when I embraced Maharaja I just said, \"Maharaja if you want me, I'm available 24/7.\"    \n \nAs it turned out, Sridhara Maharaja did take part in the abhiseka. There are many pictures of \nhim bathing Lord Caitanya during the Panca Tattva abhiseka. He was so absorbed. After the \ndeities were installed Sridhara Maharaja was more or less restricted to his room. It was then \nwhen he had devotees come to his room every evening for kirtan.  \n \nMaharaja was oftentimes lying during these evening kirtans. He couldn't get up. His body was \nswollen, although he had a way of dismissing these things. Sridhara Maharaja was known as the \n\"Jolly Swami.\" He was happy to be in the association of devotees. Sometimes his stomach \nwould swell up with fluids and the doctors had to come in to remove the fluids from his \nstomach. His brothers and a couple of other devotees were there one time when the doctors \ncame in to do the procedure. Sridhara Maharaja turned to the doctor and said, \"It's a boy.\" \n \nAnyway, Maharaja's room was full of devotees, every night. Sridhara Maharaja, because he was \nlying in bed, would oftentimes dance with his arms because he couldn't get up to sit with the \ndevotees. He would say, \"Forgive me, I can't dance, but I'm dancing with you with my arms.\"  \n \nOne night, after the GBC meetings, I had a terrible headache. I was thinking, \"I don't know if I \ncan go to the kirtan tonight with this bad headache.\" I was of two minds. \"I told Sridhara \nMaharaja that I would be there every night, but maybe tonight is an exception.\" \n \nSo after the meeting, I wrote note to Mayapura dasa, Sridhara Maharaja's secretary. I wrote \nsomething like, \"Mayapura, could you please tell Sridhara Maharaja to forgive me. I'm not \ncoming this evening. I have a terrible headache. I'm going back to my room.\" At that time I was \nstaying in the Vaisnava Academy. I had to walk a bit of a distance from the meetings to the \nacademy. While I was walking to the academy, I started to think of Sridhara Maharaja. \"Wait a \nminute. Sridhara Maharaja is lying in bed with a terminal illness, having kirtan. He's in pain. \nWhat is my headache compared to what he is going through? I have a headache. But Sridhara \n\nMaharaja is dancing with his arms with the devotees in kirtan, and I have a little headache.\" \n \nWhile meditating on that, I started to think, \"Oh I better turn around. I better go back.\" What \nseemed to be very significant became insignificant by meditating on his example. I got strength \nfrom that example. So I went back, directly to Sridhara Maharaja's room. I opened up the door, \nstood in the doorway, and the room was full as it always was. I didn't want to go in because I \ndidn't want to step over any of the devotees. But Sridhara Maharaja looked up and saw me. He \nhad received the message from Mayapura. Maharaja looked at me and said, \"Come here.\" And I \nsaid, \"Maharaja, I don't want to disrupt all of the devotees.\" And Sridhara Maharaja said, \"No. \nCome here.\" And he told the devotees. \"Make room for Niranjana Swami.\" \n \nSo, I had to follow his instructions. He's my superior. I had no idea what was coming next. He \nsat up on the bed and said, \"Sit here.\" I was thinking, \"He is going to ask me to give a lecture?\" I \nhad no idea. So I sat down and I didn't know what's next. I don't remember if there was a kirtan \nat the time but I remember feeling like I was the center of attention. I was thinking, \"What's \nSridhara Maharaja going to do?\" \n \nSridhara Maharaja turns to his servant, Mayapura dasa, and says, \"Mayapura, give me the Tiger \nBalm.\" Do you know what Tiger Balm is? He took the Tiger Balm in his hands and said, \"Look at \nme.\" He took the Tiger Balm and started to massage my forehead with it. He just kept on \nmassaging my forehead. It went on for some time. The devotees resumed the kirtan and he was \njust massaging my forehead.  \n \nMaharaja was thinking of my headache. That's a Vaisnava. How can you not love such a \nVaisnava. Here he was thinking of my headache. Such compassion. Absorbed in the holy name. \nDetermined to be in the association of devotees. This is the path we follow. We don't just have \nto go to Bhagavatam to find examples. We can find so many examples in our lives of devotees \nwho are determined to serve under all circumstances. \n \nAnother example...I was just in Boston. There's a godbrother there of mine whose name is \nMukta Vandya dasa. He's a very simple-hearted devotee. He's always engaged in service. He's \nhad two heart attacks. He had one heart attack when he was living in Gita Nagari. He used to \nsell flowers every day in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which is about an hour away from Gita \nNagari. He was married at the time. He worked very hard selling flowers, but he would use \npractically all of the money he earned for the temple. In fact, he was sleeping in a small tool \nshed filled with tools.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu wasn't thinking about accummulating money for himself. He was just \nthinking about how to accummulate money for Radha Damodara and serve the temple. He \nwould work very hard. He'd work so hard that one day he had a heart attack on his way to \nwork. Krsna arranged that he had the heart attack while driving right close to the home of a \nperson who was his auto mechanic. When his mechanic saw him, he immediately knew what \nwas happening and called the hospital. He then had to be airlifted by a helicopter and was \ntaken to another hospital. They saved him. They put whatever they had to put in him. I believe \n\nit was a stent or something like that to open up the blockage.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu gradually recovered and continued to work. He was working a little bit \neasier though. After some time, he got rid of his home when his wife moved elsewhere. So he \nstayed in the basement of the temple building in a little corner. He kept all of his belongings \nthere. He continued to work every day selling flowers and continued to give his profits to the \ntemple.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu always wore very simple clothing. The van he drove for his flower \nbusiness was not very fancy. Unfortunately he had a second heart attack. By that time I was \nalready telling him. \"Mukta, you've got to slow down. You need to take care of your body. It's \nKrsna's body. It's not your body.\" He's loved by so many devotees. He's just a simple-hearted \ndevotee who always just wants to serve. \n \nNow Mukta Vandya Prabhu lives in the Boston temple. He's careful now not to push himself too \nhard. But he's still ready to do any service that needs to be done. He's just fully engaged in \nservice. If somebody comes to the temple, he preaches to them. He has no formal position. He \nhas a little room on the second floor of the temple. Whenever guests come to the temple, they \nalways go to see Mukta. He's the friend of everybody.  \n \nIf there's nobody to give class, Mukta Vandya will go downstairs to give Bhagavad-gita class. If \nthere's nobody to cook the offering, Mukta Vandya will be the first person to run down and \ncook for Radha Gopivallabha. \n \nThe day before I left Boston, one had to leave for Croatia because his father passed away. There \nwas nobody to buy all of the bhoga for a big feast for a big ceremony the temple was having the \nnext day. I arrived at the temple and came through back door of the temple. Mukta Vandya was \nstanding there by a van full of bhoga. He had gone to purchase all the bhoga for the feast with \nanother devotee who went with him to help to carry all of it. There was nobody to buy it, \nMukta Vandya just went out to do it. \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu always goes and buys flowers for the deities. Everybody who knows him \nat the flower market loves him. Sometimes he's given thousands of dollars worth of flowers for \nfree. He's the friend of everybody. Ajata satru. He just wants to serve. He's careful. He doesn't \npush his body. He knows his limits. \n \nOnce every month for a few days he goes to serve Satsvarupa das Goswami. He took first \ninitiation from Srila Prabhpuada but second initiation from Satsvarupa das Goswami. So he goes \nthere just so that he can have an opportunity to serve.  \n \nI was telling the story the other night about Vaisnava Prema. Who was going to see Vaisnava \nPrema practically every day? Who took care of all of the arrangements for him? It was Mukta \nVandya. It was Mukta Vandya who told me the story which I shared with all of you the other \nday. When I asked Mukta Vandya, \"Is Vaisnava Prema in pain?\" He told me, \"I can't say for sure. \n\nWhen I was there two days ago, he was crying although he appeared to be asleep. He didn't \nknow I was there. He was speaking aloud though and was saying, \"How beautiful Vrndavana is.\" \nSo I don't know if he was crying from the pain or if he was crying because he was seeing the \nbeauty of Vrndavana.  \n \nIt was Mukta Vandya who made all of the arrangements after Vaisnava Prema departed. He \nalso visits another devotees whose name is Dina Dayal. He is currently in a nursing home. He \ngoes and brings him prasadam to him all of the time. Mukta Vandya lives for service.  \n \nWhy should we not meditate on such examples? Those who lives for service. This is good \nintelligence. This is the way to go back to Godhead. The way to go back to Godhead is to be \nabsorbed in service. Those who are absorbed in service are making the best preparation for \ngoing back to Godhead. When we think of them, we get strength, courage, enthusiasm and \nsatisfaction. We should be looking for such examples in our life. And, as Srila Prabhupada says \nin today's purport, which should look at their good decisions. This is parampara. This is what it \nmeans to follow in the footsteps of those who are teaching by their example how to make the \nright decisions to be engaged in devotional service.  \n \nHowever long they may have to live in this world, they'll continue living in this world \nperforming their duties. And to get both the fulfillment of their desires and good intelligence.  \n \nPrabhupada says, \"Good intelligence means to go back home, back to Godhead.\" This is what \nwe can learn from those who serve as examples. We should relish hearing about these \nexamples. These examples bring devotional service to life. It makes it real. It gives us a purpose \nfor living in this world. And it gives us a goal to achieve at the end of this life. \n \nThis is what Srila Prabhupada has instructed in this verse about the Pracetas. \n \nI'll read the verse again and then we will end.  \n \nThose who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence.\" \n \nI'm sorry I went a little bit late, but I hope the message was clear. Hare Krsna. \n \n ","attachment_name":"transcription_sb_4.30.10_english.pdf","attachment_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/sites/default/files/attachments/transcription_sb_4.30.10_english.pdf"},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"ru":{"title":"11 августа, 2018 - Ретрит учеников - Магдалиновка - Ш.Б. 4.30.10 - Английский/ Русский","event":"Retreat","topic":"Шримад Бхагаватам","translation":"Русский","location":"Magdalinivka","transcription":{"text":"","attachment_name":""},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"counters":{"audio_page_view":0,"audio_play_count":0,"downloads":"129","video_page_view":0,"en_transcription_view":0,"ru_transcription_view":0,"en_summary_view":0,"ru_summary_view":0}},{"uuid":"1f8bcffa-5bd8-42c3-b89d-081bfb0e3fe4","needs_translation":true,"created_date":"2018-08-26","published_date":"","author":"Niranjana Swami","part":"7","chapter":"15","verse":"45","download_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/download/33355","lecture_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/en/lecture/26495","duration":"01:37:59","downloads":"147","audio_link":"https://nrs-site.s3.amazonaws.com/lectures/2018/2018-08/niranjana_swami_-_sb_7.15.45_on_balarama-purnima_-c2a0almaty_26-aug-2018.mp3","soundCloud_link":"https://soundcloud.com/niranjana-swami/august-26-2018-almaty","youtube":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsg2S32qsdM?rel=gallery-all&wmode=opaque&autoplay=0"],"en":{"title":"August 26, 2018 - Almaty, Kazakhstan - Balarama Purnima Class - English/ Russian","event":"Festival","topic":"Srimad Bhagavatam","translation":"Russian","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"\n\nTranscription of a Lecture Given on Balarama Purnima, August 26, 2018, in Almaty, Kazakhstan\nThe following is a partially-edited lecture given in Almaty, Kazakhstan on Balarama Purnima, August \n26, 2018\nToday we are observing the appearance of Lord Balarama. I will first speak about, \"Who is Lord \nBalarama?.\" I will then speak on a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam in which Srila Prabhupada speaks \nabout the necessity of getting spiritual strength from Lord Balarama.\nLord Balarama is the first expansion of Lord Krsna called a svamsa expansion. There's very little \ndifference between Krsna and Balarama. They are both the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nSome of the differences are that is Krsna is blackish like the monsoon raincloud and Balarama is white.\nKrsna plays a flute and Balarama plays a buffalo horn. Sometimes Balarama carries a flute but most \noften He carries a buffalo horn in Vrndavana. Balarama sometimes carries a plow and club.\nBalarama manifested in Vrndavana as Krsna's elder brother. He first appeared in the womb of Devaki \nand later, by the arrangement of Yogamaya, He was transferred to the womb on Rohini. In Vrndavana, \nBalarama is known as Rohininandana, the son of Rohini.\nOutside of Vrndavana, Lord Balarama is manifest as Mula-sankarsana. Mula-sankarsana is the first \nexpansion coming from Lord Balarama. When Lord Balarama appeared in Vrndavana in the womb of \nRohini, this Mula-sankarsana became drawn to Him and appeared within Him. This is explained in \nGopal Campu. Just as Krsna never leaves Vrndavana, Balarama never leaves Vrndavana.\nFrom Lord Balarama manifests His plenary expansions beginning with Mula-sankarsana. As Mula-\nsankarsana, Balarama is manifest outside of Vrndavana in Mathura and Dwaraka.\nFrom Balarama also comes all living entities. Even the nitya-siddhas in the spiritual world, all of \nKrsna's devotees who are either in santa rasa, dasya rasa, sakyha rasa or vatsalya rasa are all coming \nfrom Lord Balarama. Vrndavana is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama. In fact, the whole \ndhama is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama.\nSo Balarama serves Krsna by providing all this for Krsna's pleasure in the spiritual world. Those in \nconjugal rasa, the gopis, are expansions coming from Srimati Radharani.\nIn this way, all of Krsna's eternal associates, Krsna parisada, are manifestations coming from either \nLord Balarama or Srimati Radharani in the spiritual world.\nMula-sankarsana further expands as Maha-sankarsana. As Maha-sankarsana He becomes the source of \nall of the living entities who are serving Krsna in Vaikuntha.\nWhen we say, \"From Lord Balarama comes\", it suggests that at one time, within time, the living entities\nmanifested from Lord Balarama. But we should know that being under the influence of material time, \nthese things are difficult to conceive in the material world.\n\nFor instance, Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita to Arjuna, \"Never was there a time when you did not exist, \nnever was there a time when all these kings assembled in the battlefield did not exist, never was there a \ntime when I did not exist, nor in the future will any of us cease to be.\" (BG 2.12)\nSo when we say that the living entities are all emanations or expansions coming from Lord Balarama, \nimmediately we have a tendency to think, \"Oh at some point in time, they manifested.\" However, they \nare all eternally manifest.\nJust as Krsna, as stated in Brahma Samhita, is beginningless. Lord Brahma says that Krsna is advaitam \nacyutam, anadim, ananta-rupam. He is nondual. His body is never subject to decay. He is the \nbeginning. He has no end. He is the source of everything. So beginningless means, never was there a \ntime when He did not exist.\nIn the same way, never was there a time when Lord Balarama did not exist. Never was there a time \nwhen all of Krsna's eternal associates did not exist, and the living entities, the jivas, never was there a \ntime when they did not exist. Krsna's energies are always existing simultaneously along with Krsna.\nJust like this material world goes through cycles. It's manifest, it stays for some time and then \nunmanifest. But this manifestation and unmanifestation is an eternal process without beginning or end.\nIf I give you a little time to think about it— just a little time. Never was there a time when Krsna, \nBalarama, the living entities did not exist. This cannot be understood by the limited mind. As long as \nwe are under the influence of time, it is very difficult to understand that which is existing in eternal \ntime.\nKrsna says \"the spiritual world is unmanifest, infallible, and it is the supreme destination. When one \ngoes there he never has to come back. \"When Krsna says that the spiritual world is unmanifest, does it \nmean that it doesn't exist? No. Never was there a time when it manifested. It's eternal. And Krsna says \nthat when one goes there, he never comes back. Tad dhama paramam mama. \"That is My supreme \nabode.\" (BG 8.21)\nSo, as we said, Balarama is the first expansion coming from Krsna. But when did Balarama expand \nfrom Krsna? And when did Maha-sankarsana, Mula-sankarsana expand from the original Balarama? \nAnd when from the Mula-sankarsana did Maha-sankarsana manifest in order to manifest the Vaikuntha \nplanets and all of Krsna's servants in the Vaikuntha planets who serve Him in His various forms? We \ncannot say when it happened. We only use those terms because we think in those terms. And we won't \nbe able to fully understand until we go beyond the influence of time ourselves. Those who are beyond \nthe influence of time, for them, time is ever-present. Krsna's pastimes and Balarama's pastimes in the \nspiritual world are eternally manifest.\nTime is also manifest in the spiritual world. But there it exists to assist Krsna and Balarama in Their \npastimes. There is no destructive feature of time in the spiritual world.\nEvery morning, Krsna, Balarama, and Their cowherd boyfriends after breakfast and milking the cows, \ngo out to the pastures. During the day when the sun is fully manifest in the sky, They along with the \ncowherd boys take shelter in the caves of Govardhana. As the sun continues to pass, later in the evening\nKrsna and Balarama with Their cowherd boyfriends and the cows, return to Gokula.\n\n2\nIn the spiritual world, time is manifest just to assist Krsna in His pastimes. But there is no destructive \nfeature of time as time destroys everything in the material world.\nKrsna tells Arjuna when He manifested the universal form, \"kalo 'smi loka-ksaya-krt pravrddho\", Time \nI am, the great destroyer of the worlds.\" (BG 11.32)\nSo when Krsna creates this material world, first He creates time. That's how creation takes place. \nOtherwise how could creation take place if there was no time? So when it's time for unmanifested \nmaterial elements to manifest as the external energy, time first appears.\nThen from Maha-sankarsana, as we said, in the spiritual world comes Karanadakasayi Visnu, who is \nalso a manifestation of Lord Balarama. And from Karandakasayi Visnu comes Garbodakasayi Visnu \nwho enters into each universe, which are generated from Karanadakasayi Visnu. And from \nGarbodakasayi Visnu who lies in the Garbodaka Ocean, comes the first created being in the universe, \nLord Brahma.\nThey are all expansions coming from Lord Balarama. Then there is Ksirodakasayi Visnu, who is also \nthe supersoul, manifested in the heart of all living beings. After the manifestation of Ksirodakasayi \nVisnu, comes Sesa who is a manifestation of the Lord who serves the Lord in various ways in this \nworld.\nAnanta-sesa, on each of His hoods, holds material universes. That's spiritual strength. Imagine holding \nunlimited universes on your hoods, and you standing on nothing? Try to conceive. It's inconceivable.\nSo Ananta-sea is holding all the universes on his different hoods but he rests on nothing. He is self-\nsufficient. And He is a manifestation of Lord Balarama.\nThere are two manifestations of Sesa. There's Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods, and \nthen there is the Ananta-sesa who is the bed of Lord Visnu. In the Laghu-bhagavatamrita Rupa \nGoswami explains that the Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods is an avesa avatara of \nLord Balarama. He is saktyavesa. He's an empowered jiva who holds the universe on his heads as \nAnanta-sesa.\nThe other manifestation of Sesa is a plenary expansion of Lord Balarama upon whom Lord Visnu lies.\nAnanta-sesa serves Lord Krsna, just as Lord Balarama is serving Lord Krsna in all of these different \nforms in the matter of creation and maintenance of this cosmic manifestation. Ananta-sesa is also \nmanifest as Krsna's pillow, Krsna's shoes, Krsna's bed, Krsna's sacred thread, Krsna's garments, etc.. In \nthis way, Ananta-sesa is rendering service to Krsna.\nSo Lord Balarama, in His different manifestations, is rendering service to Krsna in unlimited ways. \nEven though Lord Balarama is Krsna Himself, He is always absorbed in the mood of, \"I am Krsna's \nservant.\"\nLord Balarama's service mood towards Krsna is described as sankula, or mixed. He is Krsna's friend. \nKrsna goes out with his cowherd boyfriends. Lord Balarama is going with Him into the pasturing \n\ngrounds. He's Krsna's servant as we already described in various ways how Lord Balarama renders \nservice to Krsna. And He also has a mood of vatsalya, because He is Krsna's older brother.\nIn Vedic culture, ancient culture, the older brother is always worshipped and respected as one's \nsuperior. So Balarama also has this vatsalya mood of protecting Krsna.\nWhen Balarama and Krsna entered into the forest of Dhenukasura, Krsna spoke about Lord Balarama \nas follows:\n\"O greatest of Lords, just see how these trees are bowing their heads at Your lotus feet, which are \nworshipable by the immortal demigods. The trees are offering You their fruits and flowers to eradicate \nthe dark ignorance that has caused their birth as trees.\" (SB 10.15.5)\nSo Krsna is considering Balarama His superior. In the forest of Dhenukasura, Balarama is lying down \nwith His head on the lap of the cowherd boys and Krsna is taking Balarama's lotus feet and is \nmassaging them. So Balarama also serves Krsna in this vatsalya mood and is treated as a superior by \nKrsna. Balarama also serves Krsna in madhurya-rasa. But to do that, He is manifested as Ananga-\nmanjari, the sister of Radharani.\nBalarama is also considered Adi-guru. Adi-guru means the original guru. Just as Krsna treats Balarama \nas a superior, He also treats Him as guru. Balarama is akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda means unlimited. \nIn other words, Balarama is the guru that manifests in unlimited forms to serve as guru. And all gurus \nare understood to be representatives of Lord Balarama, who is the source of spiritual strength.\nPrabhupada explains in Krsna book. \"In the Upanisad it is stated, nayam atma bala-hinena labhyah. The\npurport is that one cannot attain the supreme platform of self-realization without being sufficiently \nfavored by Balarama. Bala does not mean physical strength. No one can attain spiritual perfection by \nphysical strength. One must have the spiritual strength which is infused by Balarama, or Sankarsana. \nAnanta, or Sesa, is the power which sustains all the planets in their different positions. Materially this \nsustaining power is known as the law of gravitation, but actually it is a display of the potency of \nSankarsana. Balarama, or Sankarsana, is spiritual power, or the original spiritual master. Therefore \nLord Nityananda Prabhu, who is also the incarnation of Balarama, is the original spiritual master. And \nthe spiritual master is the representative of Balarama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who \nsupplies spiritual strength. In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is confirmed that the spiritual master is the \nmanifestation of the mercy of Krsna.\" (Krsna Book Ch. 2)\nSo Prabhupada refers to the verse from the Mundaka Upanisad.\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvan\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nThis verse means, \"The Supreme Lord cannot be attained by one who has no spiritual strength, one \nwho is careless or wild, or whose austerites are inappropriate. The Lord appears before a person who \nstrives by the right means to attain Him. Such a person enters the spiritual world.\"\n\nOne requires spiritual strength in order to understand Krsna and to enter the spiritual world. \nPrabhupada says that we are not talking about physical strength. Spiritual strength is the strength to \novercome the influence of the modes of material nature, to cross the ocean of material existence, and to\nbecome qualified to enter into that supreme abode which is unmanifest and infallible.\nWho is the source of spiritual strength? It is Balarama who is akhanda guru tattva. He manifests \nHimself in various forms in order to give strength to the living entities in the material world so they can\nfind the determination, courage, and satisfaction to overcome the stringent laws of material nature and \nto achieve entrance into that eternal abode.\nAs the Mundaka Upanisad says, \"Krsna manifests Himself to that person who strives to achieve Him \nby the right means.\" What is the right means?\nThat is the verse we wanted to read today from Srimad Bhagavatam. This verse speaks about the right \nmeans to cross the ocean of material existence, by getting strength from the spiritual master and \npredecessor spiritual masters.\nHow can we overcome the illusory energy by our own strength? A devotee never thinks, \"I am \nspiritually strong by my own endeavors.\" He knows that whatever spiritual strength he has, has been \ngiven to him because he is taking shelter of spiritual strength.\nJust as one takes shelter of Krsna consciousness,\nkrsna -- surya-sama, maya haya andhakara\nyahan krsna, tahan nahi mayara adhikara\n\"Krsna is compared to sunshine, and maya is compared to darkness. Wherever there is sunshine, there \ncannot be darkness. As soon as one takes to Krsna consciousness, the darkness of illusion (the influence\nof the external energy) will immediately vanish. (Madhya 22.31)\nWherever there is Krsna, there cannot be maya. Wherever there is Krsna consciousness, there cannot be\nthe influence of illusion. But we cannot manifest Krsna before us by our own strength.\nSrimad Bhagavatam states:\nathapi te deva padambuja-dvaya-\nprasada-lesanugrhita eva hi\njanati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno\nna canya eko 'pi ciram vicinvan\nMy Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the \ngreatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years. (SB \n10.14.29)\nUnless one gets that drop of mercy he cannot understand.\n3\nKrsna tells Arjuna,\n\nMy dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before \nyou, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My \nunderstanding. (Bg 11.54)\nTherefore the knowledge and strength to cross over the material existence is coming from Krsna and \nBalarama. Balarama is Adi-guru, the original guru, He is the original source of all spiritual strength. If \none wishes to get spiritual strength, he must take shelter of guru and as this verse we are going to read \ntoday says, our predecessor gurus.\nSo this is the verse and purport that I am going to read in this connection. It's the 7th Canto of Srimad \nBhagavatam, 15th chapter, 45th verse.\nyavan nr-kaya-ratham atma-vasopakalpam\ndhatte garistha-caranarcanaya nisatam\njnanasim acyuta-balo dadhad asta-satruh\nsvananda-tusta upasanta idam vijahyat\nTRANSLATION\nAs long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and paraphernalia, which are \nnot fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, namely his spiritual \nmaster and the spiritual master's predecessors. By their mercy, one can sharpen the sword of \nknowledge, and with the power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's mercy one must then \nconquer the enemies mentioned above. In this way, the devotee should be able to merge into his \nown transcendental bliss, and then he may give up his body and resume his spiritual identity.\nThis verse refers to the enemies mentioned in the previous verse. So in order to more fully understand \nwhat this verse is talking about one should know what these enemies are. And this is the previous verse.\nIn the conditioned stage, one's conceptions of life are sometimes polluted by passion and \nignorance, which are exhibited by attachment, hostility, greed, lamentation, illusion, fear, \nmadness, false prestige, insults, fault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, \nbewilderment, hunger and sleep. All of these are enemies. Sometimes one's conceptions are also \npolluted by goodness. (SB 7.15.43–44)\nIs there anyone who thinks that these enemies that we've listed have all been conquered? I'll read them \none more time.\nAttachment. One by one. Hostility. Greed. Lamentation, illusion, fear, madness, false prestige, insult, \nfault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, bewilderment, hunger, sleep. All of these are \nenemies.\nBy the strength of our own intelligence, to some degree, we may be able to deal with some of these \nenemies. But Prabhupada is going to make the point very clear in the purport that simply by knowledge\nitself one cannot cut away from these enemies.\nKrsna says clearly that the living entities in the material world are struggling very hard with material \nexistence. None of us can say, \"I'm not struggling with these things.\".\n\nOftentimes devotees ask me how to deal with the fact that they are struggling with Krsna \nconsciousness. I say to them, \"You're struggling?! It's good that you're struggling. As soon as you stop \nstruggling you're finished.\" If we're struggling it means that we want to overcome these bad influences. \nThose who don't want to overcome them, think it's natural to be lusty. It's natural to be envious. They \ndon't think they are in illusion because they think illusion is reality.\nWe should therefore struggle to find the spiritual strength to overcome these enemies. That much \nstruggling we have to do. If we don't struggle for that, we'll have to struggle with material nature, \nwhich is very hard on the living entity, and causes so much anxiety.\nPrabhupada says that this material world is kuntha. It is a place of anxiety. It cannot be avoided. \nEverything in this world is temporary and the eternal living entity is going to have to be in anxiety \nabout losing that which he is attached to. So he struggles with this illusory energy.\nA devotee therefore prays. \"Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare/ Hare Rama Hare Rama \nRama Rama Hare Hare.\" He's praying to Krsna. He's praying to Lord Balarama. \"Please give me the \nstrength so that I may be engaged in Krsna's service.\" He's praying to Srimati Radharani. Please engage\nme in Krsna's service. He's looking for strength. This is his struggle.\nSo just as this verse states that \"As long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and\nparaphernalia, which are not fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, \nnamely his spiritual master and the spiritual master's predecessors.\"\nSo let me read the purport. Please take note of the emphasis Srila Prabhupada is making about strength.\nIt's a little bit long. Try to listen carefully.\nIn Bhagavad-gita (4.9) the Lord says:\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\" This is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\nIn other words, this is what it means to accept help from the superiors is to go back home, back to \nGodhead. This is the destination that Krsna wants all living entities to achieve. And Lord Balarama and\nthose in the line of Lord Balarama are meant to give us the strength to go back to the spiritual world.\nThis is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\n... to go back home, back to Godhead.\nIt is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.20.17):\nnr-deham adyam sulabham sudurlabham\nplavam sukalpam guru-karnadharam\n\nmayanukulena nabhasvateritam\npuman bhavabdhim na taret sa atma-ha\nThis human form of body is a most valuable boat, and the spiritual master is the captain, guru-\nkarnadharam, to guide the boat in plying across the ocean of nescience. The instruction of Krsna \nis a favorable breeze. One must use all these facilities to cross over the ocean of nescience. Since \nthe spiritual master is the captain, one must serve the spiritual master very sincerely so that by his\nmercy one will be able to get the mercy of the Supreme Lord.\nA significant word here is acyuta-balah. The spiritual master is certainly very merciful to his \ndisciples, and consequently by satisfying him a devotee gets strength from the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore says, guru-krsna-prasade paya \nbhakti-lata-bija: [Cc. Madhya 19.151] one must first please the spiritual master, and then one \nautomatically pleases Krsna and gets the strength with which to cross the ocean of nescience.\nThis is the point I was making before. Simply knowledge, is insufficient. One can study the Vedas for \nmillions of births, as Lord Brahma says in Brahma Samhita, and still never be able to understand \nKrsna. So it's not simply by knowledge that one can cross the ocean of material existence.\nThe purport continues:\nIf one seriously desires to return home, back to Godhead, one must therefore become strong \nenough by pleasing the spiritual master, for thus one gets the weapon with which to conquer the \nenemy, and one also gets the grace of Krsna. Simply getting the weapon of jnana is insufficient. \nOne must sharpen the weapon by serving the spiritual master and adhering to his instructions. \nThen the candidate will get the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nPrabhupada then gives a nice analogy.\nIn general warfare one must take help from his chariot and horses in order to conquer his enemy, \nand after conquering his enemies he may give up the chariot and its paraphernalia. Similarly, as \nlong as one has a human body, one should fully use it to obtain the highest perfection of life, \nnamely going back home, back to Godhead.\nUsing the human form of life to its full potential.\nkamasya nendriya-pritir\nlabho jiveta yavata\njivasya tattva-jijnasa\nnartho yas ceha karmabhih\nLife's desires should never be directed toward sense gratification. One should desire only a healthy life,\nor self-preservation, since a human being is meant for inquiry about the Absolute Truth. Nothing else \nshould be the goal of one's works. (SB 1.2.10)\nThe perfection of knowledge is certainly to become transcendentally situated (brahma-bhuta [SB \n4.30.20]). As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):\n\nbrahma-bhutah prasannatma\nna socati na kanksati\nsamah sarvesu bhutesu\nmad-bhaktim labhate param\n\"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully \njoyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living \nentities. In that state he attains pure devotional service.\" Simply by cultivating knowledge as the \nimpersonalists do, one cannot get out of the clutches of maya. One must attain the platform of \nbhakti.\nbhaktya mam abhijanati\nyavan yas casmi tattvatah\ntato mam tattvato jnatva\nvisate tad-anantaram\n\"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one \nis in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of \nGod.\" (Bg. 18.55) Unless one has attained the stage of devotional service and the mercy of the \nspiritual master and Krsna, there is a possibility that one may fall down and again accept a \nmaterial body. Therefore Krsna stresses in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\"\nThe word tattvatah, meaning \"in reality,\" is very important. Tato mam tattvato jnatva. Unless one \nunderstands Krsna in truth by the mercy of the spiritual master, one is not free to give up his \nmaterial body.\nIn other words, one has to accept another material body.\n4\nAs it is said, aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah: [SB \n10.2.32] if one neglects to serve the lotus feet of Krsna, one cannot become free from the material\nclutches simply by knowledge. Even if one attains the stage of brahma-padam, merging in \nBrahman, without bhakti he is prone to fall down. One must be very careful in regard to the \ndanger of falling down again into material bondage. The only insurance is to come to the stage of \nbhakti, from which one is sure not to fall. Then one is free from the activities of the material \nworld. In summary, as stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, one must get in touch with a bona fide\nspiritual master coming in the parampara of Krsna consciousness, for by his mercy and \n\ninstructions one is able to get strength from Krsna. Thus one engages in devotional service and \nattains the ultimate goal of life, the lotus feet of Visnu.\nSignificant in this verse are the words jnanasim acyuta-balah. Jnanasim, the sword of knowledge, \nis given by Krsna, and when one serves the guru and Krsna in order to hold the sword of Krsna's \ninstructions, Balarama gives one strength. Balarama is Nityananda. Vrajendra-nandana yei, saci-\nsuta haila sei, balarama ha-ila nitai. This bala -- Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya \nMahaprabhu, and both of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take \nshelter of Their lotus feet. They come especially to deliver the fallen souls of this age, papi tapi \nyata chila, hari-name uddharila. Their weapon is sankirtana, hari-nama. Thus one should accept \nthe sword of knowledge from Krsna and be strong with the mercy of Balarama. We are therefore \nworshiping Krsna-Balarama in Vrndavana. In the Mundaka Upanisad (3.2.4) it is said:\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvams\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nOne cannot attain the goal of life without the mercy of Balarama. Sri Narottama dasa Thakura \ntherefore says, nitaiyera karuna habe, vraje radha-krsna pabe: when one receives the mercy of \nBalarama, Nityananda, one can attain the lotus feet of Radha and Krsna very easily.\nse sambandha nahi yara,   \nbrtha janma gela tara,\nvidya-kule hi karibe tara\nIf one has no connection with Nitai, Balarama, then even though one is a very learned scholar or \njnani or has taken birth in a very respectable family, these assets will not help him. We must \ntherefore conquer the enemies of Krsna consciousness with the strength received from Balarama. \n[end of purport]\nThese enemies are like whips. They are beating us again and again, keeping us in the bodily \nidentification. Imagine living with enemies. We are living with enemies right in our own bodies.\nKrsna described the enemy as lust. When Arjuna asked Krsna, \"What is it Krsna that compels a person \nto act even against his own will?\" Krsna replied that \"It's lust only Arjuna which is later transformed in \nanger, which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world.\" How to conquer this enemy on our own \nstrength?\nThose who try to do it on the strength of their own intelligence,\ntvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\n (SB 10.2.32)\n\n[...]their intelligence is impure. They fall down from their position of imagined superiority because \nthey have no regard for Your lotus feet.\nThey are destined to fall, because they haven't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus feet. They haven't taken \nshelter of Lord Balarama. They haven't taken shelter of bhakti, which manifests through the mercy of \nthe spiritual and the predecessor spiritual masters.\nThe spiritual master must represent the predecessor spiritual masters. Only by representing the \npredecessor spiritual master can one strive to achieve the Lord by the right means.\nThe verse nayam atma bala hinena labhyo clearly states that one has to achieve the Lord by the right \nmeans. One should not be wild or careless. By the right means Krsna reveals Himself and one enters \nthe spiritual world.\n5\nThis is the meaning of akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda guru tattva means that Lord Balarama manifests \nHimself as guru in an unlimited variety of forms. And it is the service of guru to give one the strength \nto cross over the ocean of material existence to enter into the spiritual world.\nSo this is how we worship Lord Balarama on His appearance day. We should know that He is adi-guru. \nHe is the original guru and and all other gurus represent Him. Without His mercy, without taking \nshelter of Him, we will never be able to give up this sense gratification and attachment to the material \nworld.\nAs described in the song Gauranga Bolite Ha'be, Narottama das Thakur is praying.\nara kabe nitai-candera karuna karibe\nsamsara-vasana mora kabe tuccha habe\n\"When will Lord Nityananda have mercy upon me so that I can realize the uselessness of material \npleasure?'\nHe is praying in that way. Who is Nityananda? He is Lord Balarama. Nityananda is the same as Lord \nBalarama. He has appeared to serve Lord Caitanya in the same way as Lord Balarama has appeared to \nserve Lord Krsna.\nAnd as Prabhupada says in today's purport, \"Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and \nboth of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take shelter of Their lotus \nfeet.\"\nWhat is their weapon?\nkrsna-varnam tvisakrsnam\nsangopangastra-parsadam\nSB 11.5.32\nThe verse describes how Lord Caitanya appears with His weapons. What is Lord Caitanya's weapon? \nHe's not coming to chop off heads. Not coming with a club to beat and destroy. He's coming with the \nweapon of harinama sankirtan. That is the weapon He has come with in this age of Kali.\n\nSrila Bhaktisiddhanti Sarasvati Thakur describes in one article of the Harmonist Magazine.\n\"Nityananda alone possesses the distinctive function of the guru. In Nityananda the function is \nembodied. Nityananda is the servant-God. He serves Sri Gaurasundara by the distinctive method of \nreverential servitude. He is identical with Sri Balarama of krsna-lila.[...]\n[...]\"But Nityananda does not directly instruct in the confidential service of Krsna. Srimati Radhika is \nthe guru of the inner circle of the servants of Krsna. Srimati Radhika, however, accepts the offer of \nservice of only those souls who are specially favored by Nityananda and are deemed by Him to be fit \nfor Her service.\nSo in all respects we are dependent upon the mercy of Nityananda Balarama to become qualifided to \ndance in the spiritual world and to be fully engaged in loving devotional service to the Lord.\nThis is the goal. Prabhupada clearly states this right from the outset of the verse. The goal is to go back \nhome, back to Godhead. The goal is not to be happy in this material world.\nThe devotee who understands this goal may become happy in this world. But as Rupa Goswami says, \nthere is three types of happiness. 1) Happiness derived from sense gratification, which is temporary. 2) \nHappiness which comes from liberation, which can also be temporary.\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\nOne will fall down from his position of imagined superiority if he hasn't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus \nfeet.

In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence. \n \nPURPORT \nGood intelligence means going back home, back to Godhead. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita \n(10.10): \n \ntesam satata-yuktanam \nbhajatam priti-purvakam \ndadami buddhi-yogam tam \nyena mam upayanti te \n \n\"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by \nwhich they can come to Me.\" \n \nOne who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know that the highest \nperfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this verse it is \nindicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracetas, the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is \nthe way of the parampara system. If we follow the acaryas, we attain the same benefit as our \npredecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly \nhearing Bhagavad-gita from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no difference \nbetween hearing Bhagavad-gita directly from the Supreme Lord and following a personality like \nArjuna, who formerly heard Bhagavad-gita directly from the Lord. Sometimes foolish people \nargue that since Krsna is not present at the moment, one cannot take direct instructions from \nHim. Such foolish people do not know that there is no difference between directly hearing \nBhagavad-gita and reading it, as long as one accepts Bhagavad-gita as it is, spoken by the Lord. \nHowever, if one wants to understand Bhagavad-gita by his imperfect interpretations, one \ncannot possibly understand the mysteries of Bhagavad-gita, even though one may be a great \n\nscholar according to mundane estimation. \n \nNiranjana Swami: \n \nI'd like to put this verse a little bit into context before we speak about the purport Srila \nPrabhupada gave on the verse.  \n \nThis verse is spoken about the Pracetas, the sons of King Pracinabarhisat. King Pracinabarhisat \nbecame known as a Prajapati entrusted with the responsibility to create progeny. He had ten \nsons. He instructed his sons to prepare for householder life which for them meant to perform \nausterities for 10,000 years.  \n \nWhile traveling west to execute their father's order, they come upon a big lake, so big that it \nlooked like an ocean. They became captivated by the beautiful appearance of this lake. All of a \nsudden, they heard the sounds of drums, kettledrums and other instruments being played. The \nsounds were coming from within the lake. Just then, appearing from within the lake appeared \nLord Siva. Lord Siva came to them because he understood them to be highly qualified persons.  \n \nAn interesting point which I noticed when I was looking at these verses this morning is that Lord \nSiva was also attracted to the Pracetas because they were dedicated to following the order of \ntheir father. Prabhupada said in the purport that because they were surrendered to following \nthat order, Lord Siva saw the Pracetas as highly qualified persons and therefore he wanted to \ngive His association to them.  \n \nI bring this point up because yesterday we were talking about Dhruva Maharaja who was fixed \non the order of his mother. His mother requested him to follow the recommendations of his \nstepmother Suruci... to go to the forest to seek out the Supreme Lord, again, for the fulfillment \nof his desire. That point is made today in this verse also. By offering this prayer given by Lord \nSiva, the Lord told the Pracetas, \"they can both fulfill their desires and attain good intelligence.\" \n \nDhruva Maharaja went to the forest to seek out the Supreme Lord because he also wanted the \nfulfillment of his desires. We didn't speak that much on that point yesterday, but we know what \nhis desires were.  \n \nDhruva Maharaja was insulted and wanted revenge. He wanted to get a kingdom better than \nhis father's, grandfather's and great-grandfather's. He was so fixed on his mother's instructions \nthat when Narada Muni, who saw Dhruva Maharaja as a good candidate just as Lord Siva saw \nthe Pracetas as good candidates, gave Dhruva Maharaja instructions to return home, Dhruva \nMaharaja was more intent on going to the forest to obtain the darshan of the Supreme Lord. He \nhad desires he wanted fulfilled from Him.  \n \nNarada Muni tested Dhruva by instructing him, \"Just become equipoised, be self-satisfied. Do \nnot be disturbed by these things you are feeling in your heart, The forest is no place for a young \nboy like you. You're too young for such austerities. Wait until you are older.\", Dhruva Maharaja \n\nwas nonetheless fixed. \"No I have to seek out the Supreme Lord. I was told by my mother that \nHe can take care of everything for me. Sorry I know those are good instructions, but they don't \ntouch my heart. I've got something else on my mind. \n \nDhruva was fixed. \"I was told by my mother that the Lord will take care of my desires. She told \nme to go to the forest and you're telling me, 'Don't go to the forest.'\"  \n \nNarada Muni, an expert judge of time, place, and circumstances, then adjusted everything. He \nstill saw Dhruva as a good candidate and gave him instructions how he could get his desires \nfulfilled.  \n \nInterestingly, because it's similar to what we are going to hear about the Pracetas, Narada Muni \nalso gave Dhruva Maharaja a mantra to chant. He told him, \"If you chant this mantra you will be \nblessed by the Lord according to your desire.\" Srila Prabhupada explained in one purport in that \nsection about Dhruva Maharaja, that Dhruva Maharaja was initiated in the Visnu-mantra and \nwas given the mantra \"om namo bhagavate vasudevaya.\" \n \nIn the pastime with the Pracetas, the Pracetas had an order from their father. They were strictly \nfollowing his order, Lord Siva appeared to them, saw them as highly qualified persons, and told \nthem that because they were so qualified, he wanted to give them a mantra, or stotra, to \nchant. He told them that by chanting this mantra, \"...you will certainly achieve all your desired \nobjectives without fail.\" SB 4.24.79 \n \nIn connection to this point, I wanted to read a few verses from a previous chapter,  \n \n\"Although rendering devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and worshiping \nHim are very difficult, if one vibrates or simply reads this stotra [prayer] composed and sung by \nme [Lord Siva], he will very easily be able to invoke the mercy of the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead.\" (SB 4.24.76) \n \n\"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the dearmost objective of all auspicious benedictions. \nA human being who sings this song sung by me can please the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead. Such a devotee, being fixed in the Lord's devotional service, can acquire whatever he \nwants from the Supreme Lord. (SB 4.24.77) \n \nIn other words, Lord Siva is telling them, \"You can get whatever you desire to accomplish. \nWorship the Lord and get the fulfillment of your desire.\"  \n \nAnd in today's verse, after gaining darshan of the Lord, the Lord told the Pracetas,  \n \n\"Those who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence.\" (SB 4.30.10 \n \n\nAnd what did Prabhupada say in the purport today? What is good intelligence? Anyone \nremember what Prabhupada said? Yes...to go back to Godhead. That is good intelligence. He \nquotes the verse,  \n \ntesam satata-yuktanam \nbhajatam priti-purvakam \ndadami buddhi-yogam tam \nyena mam upayanti te \n \n\"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by \nwhich they can come to Me.\" (BG 10.10) \n \nThis is good intelligence. One gets the fulfillment of his desires and goes back to Godhead.  \n \nDhruva Maharaja got the fulfillment of his desires. However, in this case, when the Lord \nappeared to Dhruva and revealed all the desires that He would fulfill for him, Dhruva Maharaja \nwas completely distressed.  \n \nSomeone might ask, \"Why was he distressed? He got the fulfillment of his desires.\" But \nVisvanath Cakravarti Thakur explains that Dhruva Maharaja was distressed because the Lord \nfulfilled his previous desires. And after getting the darshan of the Lord, he realized that those \nprevious desires were so paltry, so petty. \n \nWhat were his previous desires? He wanted revenge. He wanted a kingdom. When the Lord \nappeared before Dhruva Maharaja, He told Dhruva Maharaja, \"You will get your father's throne \nand you will rule your father's kingdom for 36,000 years.\" That's what Dhruva wanted. He was \npreviously thinking, \"I couldn't sit on my father's lap. I want to be able to sit on the throne.\" But \nhe wanted something even greater than that. We'll get to that.  \n \nBut the first thing the Lord said was that \"You will rule the kingdom for 36,000 years. You will \nperform sacrifices. But you will remember Me. There will be no obstacles in your service as \nKing. You will remember the goal of your sacrifices.\" \n \nThe Lord detailed how Dhruva will rule his father's kingdom. After that, he will have a kingdom \neven better than Lord Brahma's. He will have his own planet, the polestar within this universe. \nWhen all planets in this universe are destroyed at the time of universal devastation, the \npolestar will remain. So ultimately he would rule a kingdom even better than Lord Brahma's.  \n \nIn addition, the Lord also told Dhruva, \"Your stepbrother will go to the forest to hunt and he will \nbe killed. Your stepmother, when she hears that her son has been killed in the forest, out of \ngreat despair, she will enter into the forest to look for her son and she will be devoured by a \nforest fire.\"  \n \nThese points were spoken directly to Dhruva by the Lord. And then the Lord departed.  \n\n \nAlthough Dhruva got the fulfillment of his desires, he was lamenting. \"What is the value of \nthose desires in relation to what I just experienced in the darshan of the Lord?\"  \n \nAdditionally, when the Lord appeared to Dhruva, Dhruva became so overwhelmed, he offered \nprayers to glorify the Lord. In those prayers which he personally composed, he asked for only \none benediction from the Lord. \"Please let me always be in the association of Your devotees.\" \n \nHowever, the Lord departed without saying anything about his new request. Visvanath \nCakravarti Thakur explains that that was the reason why Dhruva Maharaja was thrown into \nlamentation even though he got the darshan of the Lord. Dhruva realized that, \"The Lord \nfulfilled all of my previous desires, but He didn't respond to what I said when I saw Him.\" \nDhruva was therefore condemning himself, saying, \"I have prayed only for useless things. My \nactivities were exactly like treatment given to a person who is already dead.\" (SB 4.9.34) \n \nAnyway, Dhruva Maharaja received the fulfilment of his desires. After ruling his father's \nkingdom for 36,000 years, when it was time for him to go to his next destination, a flower \nairplane descended from Vaikuntha. Death personified appeared before him. Death personified \nis a very fearful personality to behold. Most living beings do not know how to deal with this \npersonality. But what did Dhruva Maharaja do? He stepped on the head of death personified \nand used his head as a step to get into the flower airplane to go back to Godhead. \n \nIn this connection, Narada Muni gives the analogy how lightning and illumination appear \nsimultaneously. Death is also like that for those who are fully absorbed in thinking of Krsna. This \nis how important it is to be engaged fully in devotional service. In that state of consciousness, \none is prepared to meet death personified. The transition becomes easier for a devotee fully \nengaged in devotional service.  \n \nIn summary, Dhruva Maharaja got the fulfillment of his desires. Because he worshipped the \nLord and faithfully chanted the mantra given to him by Narada Muni, he ultimately went back \nto Godhead. \n \nLord Siva is telling the Pracetas the same thing, \"Chant this prayer I've given to you, be fixed in \ndevotional service, and one can acquire whatever he wants from the Lord.\" \n \nIn an earlier chapter, it is stated,  \n \n\"A devotee who rises early in the morning and with folded hands chants these prayers sung by \nLord Siva and gives facility to others to hear them certainly becomes free from all bondage to \nfruitive activities.\" (SB 4.24.78) \n \n\"My dear sons of the King, the prayers I have recited to you are meant for pleasing the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead, the Supersoul. I advise you to recite these prayers, which are as \neffective as great austerities.\" (SB 4.24.79) \n\n \nThe Pracetas, received and accepted these prayers. They then performed austerities for 10,000 \nyears while meditating on these prayers that were given to them by Lord Siva. \n \nAfter performing their austerities and chanting this prayer, the Lord appeared to the Pracetas. \nThe Lord, being very pleased by their austerities, spoke an often-quoted verse expressing His \npleasure with the Pracetas' austerities.  \n \n\"The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear sons of the King, I am very much pleased \nby the friendly relationships among you. All of you are engaged in one occupation -- devotional \nservice. I am so pleased with your mutual friendship that I wish you all good fortune. Now you \nmay ask a benediction of Me.\" (SB 4.30.8) \n \nThis is the verse where Srila Prabhupada speaks about unity in devotional service in his purport.  \n \n\"The Lord continued: Those who remember you every evening of every day will become \nfriendly with their brothers and with all other living entities. (SB 4.30.9) \n \nThe Pracetas also offered prayers to the Lord. This is proper... to begin with glorification. We \nshould not just ask for the fulfillment of our desires. Neither does a devotee think, \"If I glorify \nthe Lord I'll get a better chance of getting my desire fulfilled.\" A devotee glorifies the Lord \nbecause he has understood the true glories of the Lord, and therefore he glorifies the Lord's \nqualities, His beauty, His characteristics, His dealings with devotees, His opulences, etc..  \n \nIn addition, in their prayers, the Pracetas requested, ...\"we pray that You will be satisfied with \nus. That is our benediction. We do not desire anything other than Your full satisfaction.\" (SB \n4.30.30) \n \nAnd their other request was: \n \n\"Dear Lord, as long as we have to remain within this material world due to our material \ncontamination and wander from one type of body to another and from one planet to another, \nwe pray that we may associate with those who are engaged in discussing Your pastimes. We \npray for this benediction life after life, in different bodily forms and on different planets.\" (SB \n4.30.33) \n \nWhy do we read, again and again, that devotees who are in the presence of the Lord, pray, \"Let \nme have the association of Your devotees?\" There must be a certain special quality of devotees \nthat inspires devotees to ask the Lord, \"Let me be in the association of Your devotees.\" \n \nThe devotee thinks, \"If I could be in the association of devotees who are always glorifying You, \nthen I'm protected. I'll never be able to forget You.\" That is what a devotee wants. Under all \ncircumstances, he wants to be able to remember the Lord. A devotee thinks, \"If I'm in the \nassociation of devotees who are always glorifying You, how can I forget You?\" \n\n \nThere are so many verses which give emphasis to the value of devotee association. \nIn fact it was Narada Muni who said to King Pracinibarhisat, the father of the Pracetas:  \n \n\"My dear King, in the place where pure devotees live, following the rules and regulations and \nthus purely conscious and engaged with great eagerness in hearing and chanting the glories of \nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, in that place if one gets a chance to hear their constant \nflow of nectar, which is exactly like the waves of a river, one will forget the necessities of life -- \nnamely hunger and thirst -- and become immune to all kinds of fear, lamentation and illusion.\" \n(SB 4.29.39–40) \n \nNarada Muni was giving King Pracinabarhisat good instruction. When Narada Muni first visited \nthe king he was trying to get him to give up his attachment to fruitive activities. He told the \nallegorical story of King Puranjana in an attempt to convince him to give up his attachments. \nAfter hearing about Puranjana and then receiving further instruction from Narada Muni, the \nKing achieved liberation and then the story of King Pracinabarhisat was finished. Vidura then \nasked Maitreya, \"Can you go back to the Pracetas? What happened to them? What did they \nachieve?\" \n \nSo as we were explaining before, the Pracetas got the darshan of the Lord. The Lord asked them \nfor a benediction and their only requests were, \"We ask that you be satisfied by our devotional \nservice and that we have the association of devotees.\" \n \nLet us remember, however, that they were performing austerities under the request of their \nfather who told them to prepare for householder life. So they wanted to fulfill the desire of \ntheir father. So what did the Lord tell them? He said that, \"Because you are all united in \ndevotional service, you will all have your own kingdoms.\" \n \nImagine, each of them having their own kingdoms with no quarreling amongst themselves. The \nLord said, \"You will always have friendly relationships with your brothers and friendly \nrelationships towards all living entities.\" And then He told them, \"You will rule those kingdoms \nfor one million years.\" A million years! Of course, it's a million of our years. In celestial years, it \nwould be less. \n \nAs the Lord told Prahlada Maharaja, He similarly told the Pracetas, \"You will always be engaged \nin sacrifice. I'll be satisfied by your sacrifices so that you will not forget the actual goal.\" \n \nSometimes one may think that, \"Once one gets the darshan of the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead one soon goes back to Godhead.\" It's like the happy ending of the story. He gets the \ndarshan of the Lord and then goes back to Godhead. But here we see in the case of Dhruva \nMaharaja, he remained, reigning over his father's kingdom for 36,000 years. With the \nPracetas... they were ruling over their kingdoms for one million years. But they would perform \ntheir duties in this world without forgetting the Lord.  \n \n\nThat is what Prabhupada explained in his purports, that we perform our duties in this world, we \ntake the mantra which has been given to us, we chant that mantra, obtaining the association of \nthe Lord, and then after performing our duties in this world perfectly in Krsna consciousness, \nwe go back to Godhead.  \n \nIt's how we are supposed to live in this world. It's not that we are all just going to chant and \nwait for the Lord to appear to deliver us. No. We must understand how to perform our duties in \nthis world, especially those duties which have been entrusted to us and take the mantra which \nhas been given to us.  \n \nSrila Prabhupada compared the mantra given to the Pracetas by Lord Siva to receiving the Hare \nKrsna mantra. By performing our duties in Krsna consciousness while chanting the Hare Krsna \nmahamantra, at the appropriate time, all perfection will be there.  \n \nThe point that Srila Prabhupada makes in today's purport is that we should follow the decisions \nmade by those persons who received instructions from the Lord. Following their decisions is as \ngood as receiving instructions from the Lord.  \n \nPrabhupada says, \"One who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know \nthat the highest perfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this \nverse it is indicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracetas, the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is \nthe way of the parampara system. If we follow the acaryas, we attain the same benefit as our \npredecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly \nhearing Bhagavad-gita from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. (SB 4.30.10 Purport) \n \nOne follows the decisions of Arjuna. In other words, by having examples to follow we get \nstrength, courage, enthusiasm and determination to continue to execute our duties in this life.  \n \nWe oftentimes quote Sri Bhaktyaloka. We referred to that quote yesterday.  \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur explains: \n \n\"After receiving initiation and instructions from a bona fide guru, a fortunate disciple should \nfollow the path of the previous sadhus. Those who are proud neglect the previous mahajanas \nand create new paths. As a result, they soon proceed on their inauspicious path and ruin \nthemselves. It is said in the Skanda Purana: \n \nsa mrgyah sreyasam hetuh \npanthah santapa-varjitah \nanavapta-sramam purve \nyena santah pratasthire \n \n\n\"One should strictly follow the easy path which the previous mahajanas have accepted. That \npath bestows great auspiciousness and is devoid of all misery.\" (Sri Bhaktyaloka, Chapter 10) \n  \nWe speak on this point a lot. Actually this is the point I was asked to speak on today. I am just \ngetting to it now. But it's all connected. It's connected to Dhruva Maharaja, it's connected to \nthe Pracetas, it's connected to Haridas Thakur about whom Bhaktivinode Thakur speaks. He \nsays that we have to have examples, our mahajanas, from whom we take shelter. We must try \nto remember their activities and to remember their decisions in order to get strength. \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur continues,  \n \n\"By discussing the path of the previous sadhus, one gets determination, courage, and \nsatisfaction. \n \nWho does Bhaktivinode Thakur use as an example? He uses the example of Haridas Thakur. \nHaridas Thakur's path wasn't such an easy path to follow. But Bhaktivinode Thakur says that by \nremembering his path it becomes easy.  \n \nDoes that mean that we have to beaten through twenty-two marketplaces? Do we have to be \nthreatened to be killed? Persecuted? Haridas Thakur was subjected to so much. He was \ndragged to prison and threatened by the Kazi. He was told to give up his convictions and to stop \nchanting the holy names. Haridas Thakur's response was, \"You can cut my body to pieces but I \nwill never give up chanting the holy name of the Lord.\" \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur explains that Haridas Thakur taught by his example three very important \nprinciples to be followed by those who follow in the footsteps of previous sadhus. The first, is \nthat one must always be determined, in all circumstances, that \"Yes. I must be determined to \nexecute my duties in this world while remembering the Lord.  \n \nThe second is to never give up the chanting of Hare Krishna.  \n \nThe third principle is to be compassionate towards all other living beings. \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur says that this is the path given by our previous acaryas which must be \nfollowed. It's the easy path. What makes it the easy path to follow? Austerities for 10,000 years \nunder the water? This is the easy path to follow? To go to the forest to eat berries and dried   \nleaves, to then give up all eating, by living off breath alone? To perform severe austerities \nstanding on one toe? This is the easy path? To be threatened, to be beaten in twenty-two \nmarketplaces until death? This is the easy path I'm supposed to follow? \n \nBy remembering them or by following their decisions, whatever difficulties or obstacles we \nneed to overcome become easier for us to surrender. Without an example it's very difficult to \ndo something on our own. \n \n\nTherefore Bhaktivinode Thakur says that those who are proud create their own paths.  \n \n\"Those who are proud neglect the previous mahajanas and create new paths. As a result, they \nsoon proceed on their inauspicious path and ruin themselves.\" (Sri Bhaktyaloka, Chapter 10) \n \nIn other words, they have no one to follow for spiritual strength.  \n \nWe accept the path established by our mahajanas as our examples to follow. By remembering \nthem, whatever difficulties we have to undergo become easier. In comparison to them, our \nausterities are small. We make ourselves think that they are just so big, so difficult, impossible \nto overcome. \"How can I ever do it? This is too much.\" \n \nBut by remembering those who made good decisions and who showed by their example how \nthey crossed the ocean of material existence and went back home, back to Godhead, we get \nstrength, courage, determination and enthusiasm. It makes it easier. That's how it becomes the \neasy path. \n \nIn this regard, I've been telling devotees recently a very practical story I experienced. It means a \nlot to me. It moves my heart. It's what gave me strength. I'm sure that many have heard this \nstory, but I'll tell it again. I love telling it.  \n \nSarvajna dasa: About Sridhara Maharaja?  \n \nYes Sridhara Maharaja. It's such a perfect example. By remembering Sridhara Maharaja, I got \nstrength. We had a previous friendly relationship with each other before he came to Mayapura \nin 2004. When Sridhara Maharaja came to Mayapura, he understood he would soon be leaving \nthis world. He had two desires he wanted fulfilled before departing. He wanted to go to \nMayapura to take part in the installation of Panca Tattva and he wanted to be with his \ngodbrothers.  \n \nHe expressed those desires when he was told by Canadian doctors that he couldn't receive a \nliver transplant because the cancer had spread too far in his body. From Canada, he met \nIndradyumna Maharaja in London and then the two of them came together to Mayapura.  \n \nSridhara Maharaja liked my kirtans. One time when Sridhara Maharaja was staying in a \ndevotee's flat near Bhaktivedanta Hospital at the same time I was being treated in \nBhaktivedanta Hospital, Sridhara Maharaja called me and asked, \"Maharaja can you come over \nand chant with me?\" He was not terminally ill at that time. But he was having a lot of health \nproblems. He was staying in an apartment trying to recover from an earlier treatment.  \n \nSo as soon as I had an opportunity I went over and visited Maharaja. When I arrived I expressed \nhow happy I was to see him. The first thing he said to me was, \"You see that harmonium over \nthere? Can we chant?\" It was just myself and Sridhara Maharaja. The two of us just sat and had \nkirtan together. \n\n \nAnother time when he was in Bombay, Maharaja asked again if I could come. But I couldn't go \nthat time. I believe he was again staying someplace near the hospital in Bombay but I was in \nPune at the Pune Yatra. From Pune I had to immediately go someplace else. So I asked \nMaharaja to forgive me. I told him I couldn't come that time but next time I would definitely \nmake the time to visit and chant together with him. \n \nThe next time I saw Maharaja was in Mayapura. A large group of devotees assembled to receive \nhim. It was a wonderful reception. There's a little funny story in this connection. When \nMaharaja arrived he had all this red around his mouth. It looked like it was blood. When the \ndevotees saw him they were shocked, but nobody wanted to say anything. They came down \nand sat in the room with Sridhara Maharaja who then said, \"I was eating red candy.\"  \n \nAnyway, when I saw Sridhara Maharaja, I embraced him and I said, \"Sridhara Maharaja I'm just \nso happy to see you.\" One of Maharaja's desires was also to have was kirtan in his room every \nnight. So when I embraced Maharaja I just said, \"Maharaja if you want me, I'm available 24/7.\"    \n \nAs it turned out, Sridhara Maharaja did take part in the abhiseka. There are many pictures of \nhim bathing Lord Caitanya during the Panca Tattva abhiseka. He was so absorbed. After the \ndeities were installed Sridhara Maharaja was more or less restricted to his room. It was then \nwhen he had devotees come to his room every evening for kirtan.  \n \nMaharaja was oftentimes lying during these evening kirtans. He couldn't get up. His body was \nswollen, although he had a way of dismissing these things. Sridhara Maharaja was known as the \n\"Jolly Swami.\" He was happy to be in the association of devotees. Sometimes his stomach \nwould swell up with fluids and the doctors had to come in to remove the fluids from his \nstomach. His brothers and a couple of other devotees were there one time when the doctors \ncame in to do the procedure. Sridhara Maharaja turned to the doctor and said, \"It's a boy.\" \n \nAnyway, Maharaja's room was full of devotees, every night. Sridhara Maharaja, because he was \nlying in bed, would oftentimes dance with his arms because he couldn't get up to sit with the \ndevotees. He would say, \"Forgive me, I can't dance, but I'm dancing with you with my arms.\"  \n \nOne night, after the GBC meetings, I had a terrible headache. I was thinking, \"I don't know if I \ncan go to the kirtan tonight with this bad headache.\" I was of two minds. \"I told Sridhara \nMaharaja that I would be there every night, but maybe tonight is an exception.\" \n \nSo after the meeting, I wrote note to Mayapura dasa, Sridhara Maharaja's secretary. I wrote \nsomething like, \"Mayapura, could you please tell Sridhara Maharaja to forgive me. I'm not \ncoming this evening. I have a terrible headache. I'm going back to my room.\" At that time I was \nstaying in the Vaisnava Academy. I had to walk a bit of a distance from the meetings to the \nacademy. While I was walking to the academy, I started to think of Sridhara Maharaja. \"Wait a \nminute. Sridhara Maharaja is lying in bed with a terminal illness, having kirtan. He's in pain. \nWhat is my headache compared to what he is going through? I have a headache. But Sridhara \n\nMaharaja is dancing with his arms with the devotees in kirtan, and I have a little headache.\" \n \nWhile meditating on that, I started to think, \"Oh I better turn around. I better go back.\" What \nseemed to be very significant became insignificant by meditating on his example. I got strength \nfrom that example. So I went back, directly to Sridhara Maharaja's room. I opened up the door, \nstood in the doorway, and the room was full as it always was. I didn't want to go in because I \ndidn't want to step over any of the devotees. But Sridhara Maharaja looked up and saw me. He \nhad received the message from Mayapura. Maharaja looked at me and said, \"Come here.\" And I \nsaid, \"Maharaja, I don't want to disrupt all of the devotees.\" And Sridhara Maharaja said, \"No. \nCome here.\" And he told the devotees. \"Make room for Niranjana Swami.\" \n \nSo, I had to follow his instructions. He's my superior. I had no idea what was coming next. He \nsat up on the bed and said, \"Sit here.\" I was thinking, \"He is going to ask me to give a lecture?\" I \nhad no idea. So I sat down and I didn't know what's next. I don't remember if there was a kirtan \nat the time but I remember feeling like I was the center of attention. I was thinking, \"What's \nSridhara Maharaja going to do?\" \n \nSridhara Maharaja turns to his servant, Mayapura dasa, and says, \"Mayapura, give me the Tiger \nBalm.\" Do you know what Tiger Balm is? He took the Tiger Balm in his hands and said, \"Look at \nme.\" He took the Tiger Balm and started to massage my forehead with it. He just kept on \nmassaging my forehead. It went on for some time. The devotees resumed the kirtan and he was \njust massaging my forehead.  \n \nMaharaja was thinking of my headache. That's a Vaisnava. How can you not love such a \nVaisnava. Here he was thinking of my headache. Such compassion. Absorbed in the holy name. \nDetermined to be in the association of devotees. This is the path we follow. We don't just have \nto go to Bhagavatam to find examples. We can find so many examples in our lives of devotees \nwho are determined to serve under all circumstances. \n \nAnother example...I was just in Boston. There's a godbrother there of mine whose name is \nMukta Vandya dasa. He's a very simple-hearted devotee. He's always engaged in service. He's \nhad two heart attacks. He had one heart attack when he was living in Gita Nagari. He used to \nsell flowers every day in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which is about an hour away from Gita \nNagari. He was married at the time. He worked very hard selling flowers, but he would use \npractically all of the money he earned for the temple. In fact, he was sleeping in a small tool \nshed filled with tools.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu wasn't thinking about accummulating money for himself. He was just \nthinking about how to accummulate money for Radha Damodara and serve the temple. He \nwould work very hard. He'd work so hard that one day he had a heart attack on his way to \nwork. Krsna arranged that he had the heart attack while driving right close to the home of a \nperson who was his auto mechanic. When his mechanic saw him, he immediately knew what \nwas happening and called the hospital. He then had to be airlifted by a helicopter and was \ntaken to another hospital. They saved him. They put whatever they had to put in him. I believe \n\nit was a stent or something like that to open up the blockage.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu gradually recovered and continued to work. He was working a little bit \neasier though. After some time, he got rid of his home when his wife moved elsewhere. So he \nstayed in the basement of the temple building in a little corner. He kept all of his belongings \nthere. He continued to work every day selling flowers and continued to give his profits to the \ntemple.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu always wore very simple clothing. The van he drove for his flower \nbusiness was not very fancy. Unfortunately he had a second heart attack. By that time I was \nalready telling him. \"Mukta, you've got to slow down. You need to take care of your body. It's \nKrsna's body. It's not your body.\" He's loved by so many devotees. He's just a simple-hearted \ndevotee who always just wants to serve. \n \nNow Mukta Vandya Prabhu lives in the Boston temple. He's careful now not to push himself too \nhard. But he's still ready to do any service that needs to be done. He's just fully engaged in \nservice. If somebody comes to the temple, he preaches to them. He has no formal position. He \nhas a little room on the second floor of the temple. Whenever guests come to the temple, they \nalways go to see Mukta. He's the friend of everybody.  \n \nIf there's nobody to give class, Mukta Vandya will go downstairs to give Bhagavad-gita class. If \nthere's nobody to cook the offering, Mukta Vandya will be the first person to run down and \ncook for Radha Gopivallabha. \n \nThe day before I left Boston, one had to leave for Croatia because his father passed away. There \nwas nobody to buy all of the bhoga for a big feast for a big ceremony the temple was having the \nnext day. I arrived at the temple and came through back door of the temple. Mukta Vandya was \nstanding there by a van full of bhoga. He had gone to purchase all the bhoga for the feast with \nanother devotee who went with him to help to carry all of it. There was nobody to buy it, \nMukta Vandya just went out to do it. \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu always goes and buys flowers for the deities. Everybody who knows him \nat the flower market loves him. Sometimes he's given thousands of dollars worth of flowers for \nfree. He's the friend of everybody. Ajata satru. He just wants to serve. He's careful. He doesn't \npush his body. He knows his limits. \n \nOnce every month for a few days he goes to serve Satsvarupa das Goswami. He took first \ninitiation from Srila Prabhpuada but second initiation from Satsvarupa das Goswami. So he goes \nthere just so that he can have an opportunity to serve.  \n \nI was telling the story the other night about Vaisnava Prema. Who was going to see Vaisnava \nPrema practically every day? Who took care of all of the arrangements for him? It was Mukta \nVandya. It was Mukta Vandya who told me the story which I shared with all of you the other \nday. When I asked Mukta Vandya, \"Is Vaisnava Prema in pain?\" He told me, \"I can't say for sure. \n\nWhen I was there two days ago, he was crying although he appeared to be asleep. He didn't \nknow I was there. He was speaking aloud though and was saying, \"How beautiful Vrndavana is.\" \nSo I don't know if he was crying from the pain or if he was crying because he was seeing the \nbeauty of Vrndavana.  \n \nIt was Mukta Vandya who made all of the arrangements after Vaisnava Prema departed. He \nalso visits another devotees whose name is Dina Dayal. He is currently in a nursing home. He \ngoes and brings him prasadam to him all of the time. Mukta Vandya lives for service.  \n \nWhy should we not meditate on such examples? Those who lives for service. This is good \nintelligence. This is the way to go back to Godhead. The way to go back to Godhead is to be \nabsorbed in service. Those who are absorbed in service are making the best preparation for \ngoing back to Godhead. When we think of them, we get strength, courage, enthusiasm and \nsatisfaction. We should be looking for such examples in our life. And, as Srila Prabhupada says \nin today's purport, which should look at their good decisions. This is parampara. This is what it \nmeans to follow in the footsteps of those who are teaching by their example how to make the \nright decisions to be engaged in devotional service.  \n \nHowever long they may have to live in this world, they'll continue living in this world \nperforming their duties. And to get both the fulfillment of their desires and good intelligence.  \n \nPrabhupada says, \"Good intelligence means to go back home, back to Godhead.\" This is what \nwe can learn from those who serve as examples. We should relish hearing about these \nexamples. These examples bring devotional service to life. It makes it real. It gives us a purpose \nfor living in this world. And it gives us a goal to achieve at the end of this life. \n \nThis is what Srila Prabhupada has instructed in this verse about the Pracetas. \n \nI'll read the verse again and then we will end.  \n \nThose who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence.\" \n \nI'm sorry I went a little bit late, but I hope the message was clear. Hare Krsna. \n \n ","attachment_name":"transcription_sb_4.30.10_english.pdf","attachment_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/sites/default/files/attachments/transcription_sb_4.30.10_english.pdf"},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"ru":{"title":"11 августа, 2018 - Ретрит учеников - Магдалиновка - Ш.Б. 4.30.10 - Английский/ Русский","event":"Retreat","topic":"Шримад Бхагаватам","translation":"Русский","location":"Magdalinivka","transcription":{"text":"","attachment_name":""},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"counters":{"audio_page_view":0,"audio_play_count":0,"downloads":"129","video_page_view":0,"en_transcription_view":0,"ru_transcription_view":0,"en_summary_view":0,"ru_summary_view":0}},{"uuid":"1f8bcffa-5bd8-42c3-b89d-081bfb0e3fe4","needs_translation":true,"created_date":"2018-08-26","published_date":"","author":"Niranjana Swami","part":"7","chapter":"15","verse":"45","download_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/download/33355","lecture_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/en/lecture/26495","duration":"01:37:59","downloads":"147","audio_link":"https://nrs-site.s3.amazonaws.com/lectures/2018/2018-08/niranjana_swami_-_sb_7.15.45_on_balarama-purnima_-c2a0almaty_26-aug-2018.mp3","soundCloud_link":"https://soundcloud.com/niranjana-swami/august-26-2018-almaty","youtube":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsg2S32qsdM?rel=gallery-all&wmode=opaque&autoplay=0"],"en":{"title":"August 26, 2018 - Almaty, Kazakhstan - Balarama Purnima Class - English/ Russian","event":"Festival","topic":"Srimad Bhagavatam","translation":"Russian","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"\n\nTranscription of a Lecture Given on Balarama Purnima, August 26, 2018, in Almaty, Kazakhstan\nThe following is a partially-edited lecture given in Almaty, Kazakhstan on Balarama Purnima, August \n26, 2018\nToday we are observing the appearance of Lord Balarama. I will first speak about, \"Who is Lord \nBalarama?.\" I will then speak on a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam in which Srila Prabhupada speaks \nabout the necessity of getting spiritual strength from Lord Balarama.\nLord Balarama is the first expansion of Lord Krsna called a svamsa expansion. There's very little \ndifference between Krsna and Balarama. They are both the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nSome of the differences are that is Krsna is blackish like the monsoon raincloud and Balarama is white.\nKrsna plays a flute and Balarama plays a buffalo horn. Sometimes Balarama carries a flute but most \noften He carries a buffalo horn in Vrndavana. Balarama sometimes carries a plow and club.\nBalarama manifested in Vrndavana as Krsna's elder brother. He first appeared in the womb of Devaki \nand later, by the arrangement of Yogamaya, He was transferred to the womb on Rohini. In Vrndavana, \nBalarama is known as Rohininandana, the son of Rohini.\nOutside of Vrndavana, Lord Balarama is manifest as Mula-sankarsana. Mula-sankarsana is the first \nexpansion coming from Lord Balarama. When Lord Balarama appeared in Vrndavana in the womb of \nRohini, this Mula-sankarsana became drawn to Him and appeared within Him. This is explained in \nGopal Campu. Just as Krsna never leaves Vrndavana, Balarama never leaves Vrndavana.\nFrom Lord Balarama manifests His plenary expansions beginning with Mula-sankarsana. As Mula-\nsankarsana, Balarama is manifest outside of Vrndavana in Mathura and Dwaraka.\nFrom Balarama also comes all living entities. Even the nitya-siddhas in the spiritual world, all of \nKrsna's devotees who are either in santa rasa, dasya rasa, sakyha rasa or vatsalya rasa are all coming \nfrom Lord Balarama. Vrndavana is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama. In fact, the whole \ndhama is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama.\nSo Balarama serves Krsna by providing all this for Krsna's pleasure in the spiritual world. Those in \nconjugal rasa, the gopis, are expansions coming from Srimati Radharani.\nIn this way, all of Krsna's eternal associates, Krsna parisada, are manifestations coming from either \nLord Balarama or Srimati Radharani in the spiritual world.\nMula-sankarsana further expands as Maha-sankarsana. As Maha-sankarsana He becomes the source of \nall of the living entities who are serving Krsna in Vaikuntha.\nWhen we say, \"From Lord Balarama comes\", it suggests that at one time, within time, the living entities\nmanifested from Lord Balarama. But we should know that being under the influence of material time, \nthese things are difficult to conceive in the material world.\n\nFor instance, Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita to Arjuna, \"Never was there a time when you did not exist, \nnever was there a time when all these kings assembled in the battlefield did not exist, never was there a \ntime when I did not exist, nor in the future will any of us cease to be.\" (BG 2.12)\nSo when we say that the living entities are all emanations or expansions coming from Lord Balarama, \nimmediately we have a tendency to think, \"Oh at some point in time, they manifested.\" However, they \nare all eternally manifest.\nJust as Krsna, as stated in Brahma Samhita, is beginningless. Lord Brahma says that Krsna is advaitam \nacyutam, anadim, ananta-rupam. He is nondual. His body is never subject to decay. He is the \nbeginning. He has no end. He is the source of everything. So beginningless means, never was there a \ntime when He did not exist.\nIn the same way, never was there a time when Lord Balarama did not exist. Never was there a time \nwhen all of Krsna's eternal associates did not exist, and the living entities, the jivas, never was there a \ntime when they did not exist. Krsna's energies are always existing simultaneously along with Krsna.\nJust like this material world goes through cycles. It's manifest, it stays for some time and then \nunmanifest. But this manifestation and unmanifestation is an eternal process without beginning or end.\nIf I give you a little time to think about it— just a little time. Never was there a time when Krsna, \nBalarama, the living entities did not exist. This cannot be understood by the limited mind. As long as \nwe are under the influence of time, it is very difficult to understand that which is existing in eternal \ntime.\nKrsna says \"the spiritual world is unmanifest, infallible, and it is the supreme destination. When one \ngoes there he never has to come back. \"When Krsna says that the spiritual world is unmanifest, does it \nmean that it doesn't exist? No. Never was there a time when it manifested. It's eternal. And Krsna says \nthat when one goes there, he never comes back. Tad dhama paramam mama. \"That is My supreme \nabode.\" (BG 8.21)\nSo, as we said, Balarama is the first expansion coming from Krsna. But when did Balarama expand \nfrom Krsna? And when did Maha-sankarsana, Mula-sankarsana expand from the original Balarama? \nAnd when from the Mula-sankarsana did Maha-sankarsana manifest in order to manifest the Vaikuntha \nplanets and all of Krsna's servants in the Vaikuntha planets who serve Him in His various forms? We \ncannot say when it happened. We only use those terms because we think in those terms. And we won't \nbe able to fully understand until we go beyond the influence of time ourselves. Those who are beyond \nthe influence of time, for them, time is ever-present. Krsna's pastimes and Balarama's pastimes in the \nspiritual world are eternally manifest.\nTime is also manifest in the spiritual world. But there it exists to assist Krsna and Balarama in Their \npastimes. There is no destructive feature of time in the spiritual world.\nEvery morning, Krsna, Balarama, and Their cowherd boyfriends after breakfast and milking the cows, \ngo out to the pastures. During the day when the sun is fully manifest in the sky, They along with the \ncowherd boys take shelter in the caves of Govardhana. As the sun continues to pass, later in the evening\nKrsna and Balarama with Their cowherd boyfriends and the cows, return to Gokula.\n\n2\nIn the spiritual world, time is manifest just to assist Krsna in His pastimes. But there is no destructive \nfeature of time as time destroys everything in the material world.\nKrsna tells Arjuna when He manifested the universal form, \"kalo 'smi loka-ksaya-krt pravrddho\", Time \nI am, the great destroyer of the worlds.\" (BG 11.32)\nSo when Krsna creates this material world, first He creates time. That's how creation takes place. \nOtherwise how could creation take place if there was no time? So when it's time for unmanifested \nmaterial elements to manifest as the external energy, time first appears.\nThen from Maha-sankarsana, as we said, in the spiritual world comes Karanadakasayi Visnu, who is \nalso a manifestation of Lord Balarama. And from Karandakasayi Visnu comes Garbodakasayi Visnu \nwho enters into each universe, which are generated from Karanadakasayi Visnu. And from \nGarbodakasayi Visnu who lies in the Garbodaka Ocean, comes the first created being in the universe, \nLord Brahma.\nThey are all expansions coming from Lord Balarama. Then there is Ksirodakasayi Visnu, who is also \nthe supersoul, manifested in the heart of all living beings. After the manifestation of Ksirodakasayi \nVisnu, comes Sesa who is a manifestation of the Lord who serves the Lord in various ways in this \nworld.\nAnanta-sesa, on each of His hoods, holds material universes. That's spiritual strength. Imagine holding \nunlimited universes on your hoods, and you standing on nothing? Try to conceive. It's inconceivable.\nSo Ananta-sea is holding all the universes on his different hoods but he rests on nothing. He is self-\nsufficient. And He is a manifestation of Lord Balarama.\nThere are two manifestations of Sesa. There's Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods, and \nthen there is the Ananta-sesa who is the bed of Lord Visnu. In the Laghu-bhagavatamrita Rupa \nGoswami explains that the Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods is an avesa avatara of \nLord Balarama. He is saktyavesa. He's an empowered jiva who holds the universe on his heads as \nAnanta-sesa.\nThe other manifestation of Sesa is a plenary expansion of Lord Balarama upon whom Lord Visnu lies.\nAnanta-sesa serves Lord Krsna, just as Lord Balarama is serving Lord Krsna in all of these different \nforms in the matter of creation and maintenance of this cosmic manifestation. Ananta-sesa is also \nmanifest as Krsna's pillow, Krsna's shoes, Krsna's bed, Krsna's sacred thread, Krsna's garments, etc.. In \nthis way, Ananta-sesa is rendering service to Krsna.\nSo Lord Balarama, in His different manifestations, is rendering service to Krsna in unlimited ways. \nEven though Lord Balarama is Krsna Himself, He is always absorbed in the mood of, \"I am Krsna's \nservant.\"\nLord Balarama's service mood towards Krsna is described as sankula, or mixed. He is Krsna's friend. \nKrsna goes out with his cowherd boyfriends. Lord Balarama is going with Him into the pasturing \n\ngrounds. He's Krsna's servant as we already described in various ways how Lord Balarama renders \nservice to Krsna. And He also has a mood of vatsalya, because He is Krsna's older brother.\nIn Vedic culture, ancient culture, the older brother is always worshipped and respected as one's \nsuperior. So Balarama also has this vatsalya mood of protecting Krsna.\nWhen Balarama and Krsna entered into the forest of Dhenukasura, Krsna spoke about Lord Balarama \nas follows:\n\"O greatest of Lords, just see how these trees are bowing their heads at Your lotus feet, which are \nworshipable by the immortal demigods. The trees are offering You their fruits and flowers to eradicate \nthe dark ignorance that has caused their birth as trees.\" (SB 10.15.5)\nSo Krsna is considering Balarama His superior. In the forest of Dhenukasura, Balarama is lying down \nwith His head on the lap of the cowherd boys and Krsna is taking Balarama's lotus feet and is \nmassaging them. So Balarama also serves Krsna in this vatsalya mood and is treated as a superior by \nKrsna. Balarama also serves Krsna in madhurya-rasa. But to do that, He is manifested as Ananga-\nmanjari, the sister of Radharani.\nBalarama is also considered Adi-guru. Adi-guru means the original guru. Just as Krsna treats Balarama \nas a superior, He also treats Him as guru. Balarama is akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda means unlimited. \nIn other words, Balarama is the guru that manifests in unlimited forms to serve as guru. And all gurus \nare understood to be representatives of Lord Balarama, who is the source of spiritual strength.\nPrabhupada explains in Krsna book. \"In the Upanisad it is stated, nayam atma bala-hinena labhyah. The\npurport is that one cannot attain the supreme platform of self-realization without being sufficiently \nfavored by Balarama. Bala does not mean physical strength. No one can attain spiritual perfection by \nphysical strength. One must have the spiritual strength which is infused by Balarama, or Sankarsana. \nAnanta, or Sesa, is the power which sustains all the planets in their different positions. Materially this \nsustaining power is known as the law of gravitation, but actually it is a display of the potency of \nSankarsana. Balarama, or Sankarsana, is spiritual power, or the original spiritual master. Therefore \nLord Nityananda Prabhu, who is also the incarnation of Balarama, is the original spiritual master. And \nthe spiritual master is the representative of Balarama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who \nsupplies spiritual strength. In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is confirmed that the spiritual master is the \nmanifestation of the mercy of Krsna.\" (Krsna Book Ch. 2)\nSo Prabhupada refers to the verse from the Mundaka Upanisad.\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvan\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nThis verse means, \"The Supreme Lord cannot be attained by one who has no spiritual strength, one \nwho is careless or wild, or whose austerites are inappropriate. The Lord appears before a person who \nstrives by the right means to attain Him. Such a person enters the spiritual world.\"\n\nOne requires spiritual strength in order to understand Krsna and to enter the spiritual world. \nPrabhupada says that we are not talking about physical strength. Spiritual strength is the strength to \novercome the influence of the modes of material nature, to cross the ocean of material existence, and to\nbecome qualified to enter into that supreme abode which is unmanifest and infallible.\nWho is the source of spiritual strength? It is Balarama who is akhanda guru tattva. He manifests \nHimself in various forms in order to give strength to the living entities in the material world so they can\nfind the determination, courage, and satisfaction to overcome the stringent laws of material nature and \nto achieve entrance into that eternal abode.\nAs the Mundaka Upanisad says, \"Krsna manifests Himself to that person who strives to achieve Him \nby the right means.\" What is the right means?\nThat is the verse we wanted to read today from Srimad Bhagavatam. This verse speaks about the right \nmeans to cross the ocean of material existence, by getting strength from the spiritual master and \npredecessor spiritual masters.\nHow can we overcome the illusory energy by our own strength? A devotee never thinks, \"I am \nspiritually strong by my own endeavors.\" He knows that whatever spiritual strength he has, has been \ngiven to him because he is taking shelter of spiritual strength.\nJust as one takes shelter of Krsna consciousness,\nkrsna -- surya-sama, maya haya andhakara\nyahan krsna, tahan nahi mayara adhikara\n\"Krsna is compared to sunshine, and maya is compared to darkness. Wherever there is sunshine, there \ncannot be darkness. As soon as one takes to Krsna consciousness, the darkness of illusion (the influence\nof the external energy) will immediately vanish. (Madhya 22.31)\nWherever there is Krsna, there cannot be maya. Wherever there is Krsna consciousness, there cannot be\nthe influence of illusion. But we cannot manifest Krsna before us by our own strength.\nSrimad Bhagavatam states:\nathapi te deva padambuja-dvaya-\nprasada-lesanugrhita eva hi\njanati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno\nna canya eko 'pi ciram vicinvan\nMy Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the \ngreatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years. (SB \n10.14.29)\nUnless one gets that drop of mercy he cannot understand.\n3\nKrsna tells Arjuna,\n\nMy dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before \nyou, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My \nunderstanding. (Bg 11.54)\nTherefore the knowledge and strength to cross over the material existence is coming from Krsna and \nBalarama. Balarama is Adi-guru, the original guru, He is the original source of all spiritual strength. If \none wishes to get spiritual strength, he must take shelter of guru and as this verse we are going to read \ntoday says, our predecessor gurus.\nSo this is the verse and purport that I am going to read in this connection. It's the 7th Canto of Srimad \nBhagavatam, 15th chapter, 45th verse.\nyavan nr-kaya-ratham atma-vasopakalpam\ndhatte garistha-caranarcanaya nisatam\njnanasim acyuta-balo dadhad asta-satruh\nsvananda-tusta upasanta idam vijahyat\nTRANSLATION\nAs long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and paraphernalia, which are \nnot fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, namely his spiritual \nmaster and the spiritual master's predecessors. By their mercy, one can sharpen the sword of \nknowledge, and with the power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's mercy one must then \nconquer the enemies mentioned above. In this way, the devotee should be able to merge into his \nown transcendental bliss, and then he may give up his body and resume his spiritual identity.\nThis verse refers to the enemies mentioned in the previous verse. So in order to more fully understand \nwhat this verse is talking about one should know what these enemies are. And this is the previous verse.\nIn the conditioned stage, one's conceptions of life are sometimes polluted by passion and \nignorance, which are exhibited by attachment, hostility, greed, lamentation, illusion, fear, \nmadness, false prestige, insults, fault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, \nbewilderment, hunger and sleep. All of these are enemies. Sometimes one's conceptions are also \npolluted by goodness. (SB 7.15.43–44)\nIs there anyone who thinks that these enemies that we've listed have all been conquered? I'll read them \none more time.\nAttachment. One by one. Hostility. Greed. Lamentation, illusion, fear, madness, false prestige, insult, \nfault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, bewilderment, hunger, sleep. All of these are \nenemies.\nBy the strength of our own intelligence, to some degree, we may be able to deal with some of these \nenemies. But Prabhupada is going to make the point very clear in the purport that simply by knowledge\nitself one cannot cut away from these enemies.\nKrsna says clearly that the living entities in the material world are struggling very hard with material \nexistence. None of us can say, \"I'm not struggling with these things.\".\n\nOftentimes devotees ask me how to deal with the fact that they are struggling with Krsna \nconsciousness. I say to them, \"You're struggling?! It's good that you're struggling. As soon as you stop \nstruggling you're finished.\" If we're struggling it means that we want to overcome these bad influences. \nThose who don't want to overcome them, think it's natural to be lusty. It's natural to be envious. They \ndon't think they are in illusion because they think illusion is reality.\nWe should therefore struggle to find the spiritual strength to overcome these enemies. That much \nstruggling we have to do. If we don't struggle for that, we'll have to struggle with material nature, \nwhich is very hard on the living entity, and causes so much anxiety.\nPrabhupada says that this material world is kuntha. It is a place of anxiety. It cannot be avoided. \nEverything in this world is temporary and the eternal living entity is going to have to be in anxiety \nabout losing that which he is attached to. So he struggles with this illusory energy.\nA devotee therefore prays. \"Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare/ Hare Rama Hare Rama \nRama Rama Hare Hare.\" He's praying to Krsna. He's praying to Lord Balarama. \"Please give me the \nstrength so that I may be engaged in Krsna's service.\" He's praying to Srimati Radharani. Please engage\nme in Krsna's service. He's looking for strength. This is his struggle.\nSo just as this verse states that \"As long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and\nparaphernalia, which are not fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, \nnamely his spiritual master and the spiritual master's predecessors.\"\nSo let me read the purport. Please take note of the emphasis Srila Prabhupada is making about strength.\nIt's a little bit long. Try to listen carefully.\nIn Bhagavad-gita (4.9) the Lord says:\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\" This is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\nIn other words, this is what it means to accept help from the superiors is to go back home, back to \nGodhead. This is the destination that Krsna wants all living entities to achieve. And Lord Balarama and\nthose in the line of Lord Balarama are meant to give us the strength to go back to the spiritual world.\nThis is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\n... to go back home, back to Godhead.\nIt is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.20.17):\nnr-deham adyam sulabham sudurlabham\nplavam sukalpam guru-karnadharam\n\nmayanukulena nabhasvateritam\npuman bhavabdhim na taret sa atma-ha\nThis human form of body is a most valuable boat, and the spiritual master is the captain, guru-\nkarnadharam, to guide the boat in plying across the ocean of nescience. The instruction of Krsna \nis a favorable breeze. One must use all these facilities to cross over the ocean of nescience. Since \nthe spiritual master is the captain, one must serve the spiritual master very sincerely so that by his\nmercy one will be able to get the mercy of the Supreme Lord.\nA significant word here is acyuta-balah. The spiritual master is certainly very merciful to his \ndisciples, and consequently by satisfying him a devotee gets strength from the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore says, guru-krsna-prasade paya \nbhakti-lata-bija: [Cc. Madhya 19.151] one must first please the spiritual master, and then one \nautomatically pleases Krsna and gets the strength with which to cross the ocean of nescience.\nThis is the point I was making before. Simply knowledge, is insufficient. One can study the Vedas for \nmillions of births, as Lord Brahma says in Brahma Samhita, and still never be able to understand \nKrsna. So it's not simply by knowledge that one can cross the ocean of material existence.\nThe purport continues:\nIf one seriously desires to return home, back to Godhead, one must therefore become strong \nenough by pleasing the spiritual master, for thus one gets the weapon with which to conquer the \nenemy, and one also gets the grace of Krsna. Simply getting the weapon of jnana is insufficient. \nOne must sharpen the weapon by serving the spiritual master and adhering to his instructions. \nThen the candidate will get the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nPrabhupada then gives a nice analogy.\nIn general warfare one must take help from his chariot and horses in order to conquer his enemy, \nand after conquering his enemies he may give up the chariot and its paraphernalia. Similarly, as \nlong as one has a human body, one should fully use it to obtain the highest perfection of life, \nnamely going back home, back to Godhead.\nUsing the human form of life to its full potential.\nkamasya nendriya-pritir\nlabho jiveta yavata\njivasya tattva-jijnasa\nnartho yas ceha karmabhih\nLife's desires should never be directed toward sense gratification. One should desire only a healthy life,\nor self-preservation, since a human being is meant for inquiry about the Absolute Truth. Nothing else \nshould be the goal of one's works. (SB 1.2.10)\nThe perfection of knowledge is certainly to become transcendentally situated (brahma-bhuta [SB \n4.30.20]). As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):\n\nbrahma-bhutah prasannatma\nna socati na kanksati\nsamah sarvesu bhutesu\nmad-bhaktim labhate param\n\"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully \njoyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living \nentities. In that state he attains pure devotional service.\" Simply by cultivating knowledge as the \nimpersonalists do, one cannot get out of the clutches of maya. One must attain the platform of \nbhakti.\nbhaktya mam abhijanati\nyavan yas casmi tattvatah\ntato mam tattvato jnatva\nvisate tad-anantaram\n\"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one \nis in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of \nGod.\" (Bg. 18.55) Unless one has attained the stage of devotional service and the mercy of the \nspiritual master and Krsna, there is a possibility that one may fall down and again accept a \nmaterial body. Therefore Krsna stresses in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\"\nThe word tattvatah, meaning \"in reality,\" is very important. Tato mam tattvato jnatva. Unless one \nunderstands Krsna in truth by the mercy of the spiritual master, one is not free to give up his \nmaterial body.\nIn other words, one has to accept another material body.\n4\nAs it is said, aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah: [SB \n10.2.32] if one neglects to serve the lotus feet of Krsna, one cannot become free from the material\nclutches simply by knowledge. Even if one attains the stage of brahma-padam, merging in \nBrahman, without bhakti he is prone to fall down. One must be very careful in regard to the \ndanger of falling down again into material bondage. The only insurance is to come to the stage of \nbhakti, from which one is sure not to fall. Then one is free from the activities of the material \nworld. In summary, as stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, one must get in touch with a bona fide\nspiritual master coming in the parampara of Krsna consciousness, for by his mercy and \n\ninstructions one is able to get strength from Krsna. Thus one engages in devotional service and \nattains the ultimate goal of life, the lotus feet of Visnu.\nSignificant in this verse are the words jnanasim acyuta-balah. Jnanasim, the sword of knowledge, \nis given by Krsna, and when one serves the guru and Krsna in order to hold the sword of Krsna's \ninstructions, Balarama gives one strength. Balarama is Nityananda. Vrajendra-nandana yei, saci-\nsuta haila sei, balarama ha-ila nitai. This bala -- Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya \nMahaprabhu, and both of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take \nshelter of Their lotus feet. They come especially to deliver the fallen souls of this age, papi tapi \nyata chila, hari-name uddharila. Their weapon is sankirtana, hari-nama. Thus one should accept \nthe sword of knowledge from Krsna and be strong with the mercy of Balarama. We are therefore \nworshiping Krsna-Balarama in Vrndavana. In the Mundaka Upanisad (3.2.4) it is said:\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvams\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nOne cannot attain the goal of life without the mercy of Balarama. Sri Narottama dasa Thakura \ntherefore says, nitaiyera karuna habe, vraje radha-krsna pabe: when one receives the mercy of \nBalarama, Nityananda, one can attain the lotus feet of Radha and Krsna very easily.\nse sambandha nahi yara,   \nbrtha janma gela tara,\nvidya-kule hi karibe tara\nIf one has no connection with Nitai, Balarama, then even though one is a very learned scholar or \njnani or has taken birth in a very respectable family, these assets will not help him. We must \ntherefore conquer the enemies of Krsna consciousness with the strength received from Balarama. \n[end of purport]\nThese enemies are like whips. They are beating us again and again, keeping us in the bodily \nidentification. Imagine living with enemies. We are living with enemies right in our own bodies.\nKrsna described the enemy as lust. When Arjuna asked Krsna, \"What is it Krsna that compels a person \nto act even against his own will?\" Krsna replied that \"It's lust only Arjuna which is later transformed in \nanger, which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world.\" How to conquer this enemy on our own \nstrength?\nThose who try to do it on the strength of their own intelligence,\ntvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\n (SB 10.2.32)\n\n[...]their intelligence is impure. They fall down from their position of imagined superiority because \nthey have no regard for Your lotus feet.\nThey are destined to fall, because they haven't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus feet. They haven't taken \nshelter of Lord Balarama. They haven't taken shelter of bhakti, which manifests through the mercy of \nthe spiritual and the predecessor spiritual masters.\nThe spiritual master must represent the predecessor spiritual masters. Only by representing the \npredecessor spiritual master can one strive to achieve the Lord by the right means.\nThe verse nayam atma bala hinena labhyo clearly states that one has to achieve the Lord by the right \nmeans. One should not be wild or careless. By the right means Krsna reveals Himself and one enters \nthe spiritual world.\n5\nThis is the meaning of akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda guru tattva means that Lord Balarama manifests \nHimself as guru in an unlimited variety of forms. And it is the service of guru to give one the strength \nto cross over the ocean of material existence to enter into the spiritual world.\nSo this is how we worship Lord Balarama on His appearance day. We should know that He is adi-guru. \nHe is the original guru and and all other gurus represent Him. Without His mercy, without taking \nshelter of Him, we will never be able to give up this sense gratification and attachment to the material \nworld.\nAs described in the song Gauranga Bolite Ha'be, Narottama das Thakur is praying.\nara kabe nitai-candera karuna karibe\nsamsara-vasana mora kabe tuccha habe\n\"When will Lord Nityananda have mercy upon me so that I can realize the uselessness of material \npleasure?'\nHe is praying in that way. Who is Nityananda? He is Lord Balarama. Nityananda is the same as Lord \nBalarama. He has appeared to serve Lord Caitanya in the same way as Lord Balarama has appeared to \nserve Lord Krsna.\nAnd as Prabhupada says in today's purport, \"Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and \nboth of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take shelter of Their lotus \nfeet.\"\nWhat is their weapon?\nkrsna-varnam tvisakrsnam\nsangopangastra-parsadam\nSB 11.5.32\nThe verse describes how Lord Caitanya appears with His weapons. What is Lord Caitanya's weapon? \nHe's not coming to chop off heads. Not coming with a club to beat and destroy. He's coming with the \nweapon of harinama sankirtan. That is the weapon He has come with in this age of Kali.\n\nSrila Bhaktisiddhanti Sarasvati Thakur describes in one article of the Harmonist Magazine.\n\"Nityananda alone possesses the distinctive function of the guru. In Nityananda the function is \nembodied. Nityananda is the servant-God. He serves Sri Gaurasundara by the distinctive method of \nreverential servitude. He is identical with Sri Balarama of krsna-lila.[...]\n[...]\"But Nityananda does not directly instruct in the confidential service of Krsna. Srimati Radhika is \nthe guru of the inner circle of the servants of Krsna. Srimati Radhika, however, accepts the offer of \nservice of only those souls who are specially favored by Nityananda and are deemed by Him to be fit \nfor Her service.\nSo in all respects we are dependent upon the mercy of Nityananda Balarama to become qualifided to \ndance in the spiritual world and to be fully engaged in loving devotional service to the Lord.\nThis is the goal. Prabhupada clearly states this right from the outset of the verse. The goal is to go back \nhome, back to Godhead. The goal is not to be happy in this material world.\nThe devotee who understands this goal may become happy in this world. But as Rupa Goswami says, \nthere is three types of happiness. 1) Happiness derived from sense gratification, which is temporary. 2) \nHappiness which comes from liberation, which can also be temporary.\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\nOne will fall down from his position of imagined superiority if he hasn't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus \nfeet. And 3) The happiness which comes from bhakti, by realizing\njivera 'svarupa' haya -- krsnera 'nitya-dasa'\nI am Krsna's eternal servant, and my only business in life is to find shelter at His lotus feet. This is real \nhappiness.\nBy the mercy of guru, by the mercy of predecessor gurus, and by the mercy of Lord Balarama. This is \nwhat it means to take shelter. And this is why we observe Lord Balarama's appearance day... to pray for\nthis strength.\nHare Krsna","attachment_name":"balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf","attachment_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/sites/default/files/attachments/balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf"},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"ru":{"title":"26 августа, 2018 - Алматы, Казахстан - Лекция на Баларама Пурниме - Английский/ Русский","event":"Festival","topic":"Шримад Бхагаватам","translation":"Русский","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"","attachment_name":""},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"counters":{"audio_page_view":0,"audio_play_count":0,"downloads":"147","video_page_view":0,"en_transcription_view":0,"ru_transcription_view":0,"en_summary_view":0,"ru_summary_view":0}},{"uuid":"eb9ba9ea-4a8e-4ab5-9a58-03009d5e764e","needs_translation":true,"created_date":"2018-08-11","published_date":"","author":"Niranjana Swami","part":"4","chapter":"30","verse":"10","download_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/download/33333","lecture_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/en/lecture/26394","duration":"01:56:48","downloads":"129","audio_link":"https://nrs-site.s3.amazonaws.com/lectures/2018/2018-08/2018.08.11_e.s.nirandzhana_svami._shb-4.30.10_retrit.magdalinovka-lower_compression.mp3","soundCloud_link":"https://soundcloud.com/niranjana-swami/august-11-2013-disciple","youtube":"","en":{"title":"August 11, 2018 - Disciple Retreat - Magdalinivka - SB 4.30.10 - English/ Russian","event":"Retreat","topic":"Srimad Bhagavatam","translation":"Russian","location":"Magdalinivka","transcription":{"text":"\n\nAugust 11, 2018 – Disciple Retreat in Magdalinivka – SB 4.30.10 \n \nThe following is a partially-edited transcription of a lecture given on August 11, 2018, at the \nDisciple Retreat in Magdalinivka, Ukraine: \n \n \nye tu mam rudra-gitena \nsayam pratah samahitah \nstuvanty aham kama-varan \ndasye prajnam ca sobhanam \n \nTRANSLATION \nThose who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence. \n \nPURPORT \nGood intelligence means going back home, back to Godhead. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita \n(10.10): \n \ntesam satata-yuktanam \nbhajatam priti-purvakam \ndadami buddhi-yogam tam \nyena mam upayanti te \n \n\"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by \nwhich they can come to Me.\" \n \nOne who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know that the highest \nperfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this verse it is \nindicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracetas, the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is \nthe way of the parampara system. If we follow the acaryas, we attain the same benefit as our \npredecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly \nhearing Bhagavad-gita from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no difference \nbetween hearing Bhagavad-gita directly from the Supreme Lord and following a personality like \nArjuna, who formerly heard Bhagavad-gita directly from the Lord. Sometimes foolish people \nargue that since Krsna is not present at the moment, one cannot take direct instructions from \nHim. Such foolish people do not know that there is no difference between directly hearing \nBhagavad-gita and reading it, as long as one accepts Bhagavad-gita as it is, spoken by the Lord. \nHowever, if one wants to understand Bhagavad-gita by his imperfect interpretations, one \ncannot possibly understand the mysteries of Bhagavad-gita, even though one may be a great \n\nscholar according to mundane estimation. \n \nNiranjana Swami: \n \nI'd like to put this verse a little bit into context before we speak about the purport Srila \nPrabhupada gave on the verse.  \n \nThis verse is spoken about the Pracetas, the sons of King Pracinabarhisat. King Pracinabarhisat \nbecame known as a Prajapati entrusted with the responsibility to create progeny. He had ten \nsons. He instructed his sons to prepare for householder life which for them meant to perform \nausterities for 10,000 years.  \n \nWhile traveling west to execute their father's order, they come upon a big lake, so big that it \nlooked like an ocean. They became captivated by the beautiful appearance of this lake. All of a \nsudden, they heard the sounds of drums, kettledrums and other instruments being played. The \nsounds were coming from within the lake. Just then, appearing from within the lake appeared \nLord Siva. Lord Siva came to them because he understood them to be highly qualified persons.  \n \nAn interesting point which I noticed when I was looking at these verses this morning is that Lord \nSiva was also attracted to the Pracetas because they were dedicated to following the order of \ntheir father. Prabhupada said in the purport that because they were surrendered to following \nthat order, Lord Siva saw the Pracetas as highly qualified persons and therefore he wanted to \ngive His association to them.  \n \nI bring this point up because yesterday we were talking about Dhruva Maharaja who was fixed \non the order of his mother. His mother requested him to follow the recommendations of his \nstepmother Suruci... to go to the forest to seek out the Supreme Lord, again, for the fulfillment \nof his desire. That point is made today in this verse also. By offering this prayer given by Lord \nSiva, the Lord told the Pracetas, \"they can both fulfill their desires and attain good intelligence.\" \n \nDhruva Maharaja went to the forest to seek out the Supreme Lord because he also wanted the \nfulfillment of his desires. We didn't speak that much on that point yesterday, but we know what \nhis desires were.  \n \nDhruva Maharaja was insulted and wanted revenge. He wanted to get a kingdom better than \nhis father's, grandfather's and great-grandfather's. He was so fixed on his mother's instructions \nthat when Narada Muni, who saw Dhruva Maharaja as a good candidate just as Lord Siva saw \nthe Pracetas as good candidates, gave Dhruva Maharaja instructions to return home, Dhruva \nMaharaja was more intent on going to the forest to obtain the darshan of the Supreme Lord. He \nhad desires he wanted fulfilled from Him.  \n \nNarada Muni tested Dhruva by instructing him, \"Just become equipoised, be self-satisfied. Do \nnot be disturbed by these things you are feeling in your heart, The forest is no place for a young \nboy like you. You're too young for such austerities. Wait until you are older.\", Dhruva Maharaja \n\nwas nonetheless fixed. \"No I have to seek out the Supreme Lord. I was told by my mother that \nHe can take care of everything for me. Sorry I know those are good instructions, but they don't \ntouch my heart. I've got something else on my mind. \n \nDhruva was fixed. \"I was told by my mother that the Lord will take care of my desires. She told \nme to go to the forest and you're telling me, 'Don't go to the forest.'\"  \n \nNarada Muni, an expert judge of time, place, and circumstances, then adjusted everything. He \nstill saw Dhruva as a good candidate and gave him instructions how he could get his desires \nfulfilled.  \n \nInterestingly, because it's similar to what we are going to hear about the Pracetas, Narada Muni \nalso gave Dhruva Maharaja a mantra to chant. He told him, \"If you chant this mantra you will be \nblessed by the Lord according to your desire.\" Srila Prabhupada explained in one purport in that \nsection about Dhruva Maharaja, that Dhruva Maharaja was initiated in the Visnu-mantra and \nwas given the mantra \"om namo bhagavate vasudevaya.\" \n \nIn the pastime with the Pracetas, the Pracetas had an order from their father. They were strictly \nfollowing his order, Lord Siva appeared to them, saw them as highly qualified persons, and told \nthem that because they were so qualified, he wanted to give them a mantra, or stotra, to \nchant. He told them that by chanting this mantra, \"...you will certainly achieve all your desired \nobjectives without fail.\" SB 4.24.79 \n \nIn connection to this point, I wanted to read a few verses from a previous chapter,  \n \n\"Although rendering devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and worshiping \nHim are very difficult, if one vibrates or simply reads this stotra [prayer] composed and sung by \nme [Lord Siva], he will very easily be able to invoke the mercy of the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead.\" (SB 4.24.76) \n \n\"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the dearmost objective of all auspicious benedictions. \nA human being who sings this song sung by me can please the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead. Such a devotee, being fixed in the Lord's devotional service, can acquire whatever he \nwants from the Supreme Lord. (SB 4.24.77) \n \nIn other words, Lord Siva is telling them, \"You can get whatever you desire to accomplish. \nWorship the Lord and get the fulfillment of your desire.\"  \n \nAnd in today's verse, after gaining darshan of the Lord, the Lord told the Pracetas,  \n \n\"Those who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence.\" (SB 4.30.10 \n \n\nAnd what did Prabhupada say in the purport today? What is good intelligence? Anyone \nremember what Prabhupada said? Yes...to go back to Godhead. That is good intelligence. He \nquotes the verse,  \n \ntesam satata-yuktanam \nbhajatam priti-purvakam \ndadami buddhi-yogam tam \nyena mam upayanti te \n \n\"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by \nwhich they can come to Me.\" (BG 10.10) \n \nThis is good intelligence. One gets the fulfillment of his desires and goes back to Godhead.  \n \nDhruva Maharaja got the fulfillment of his desires. However, in this case, when the Lord \nappeared to Dhruva and revealed all the desires that He would fulfill for him, Dhruva Maharaja \nwas completely distressed.  \n \nSomeone might ask, \"Why was he distressed? He got the fulfillment of his desires.\" But \nVisvanath Cakravarti Thakur explains that Dhruva Maharaja was distressed because the Lord \nfulfilled his previous desires. And after getting the darshan of the Lord, he realized that those \nprevious desires were so paltry, so petty. \n \nWhat were his previous desires? He wanted revenge. He wanted a kingdom. When the Lord \nappeared before Dhruva Maharaja, He told Dhruva Maharaja, \"You will get your father's throne \nand you will rule your father's kingdom for 36,000 years.\" That's what Dhruva wanted. He was \npreviously thinking, \"I couldn't sit on my father's lap. I want to be able to sit on the throne.\" But \nhe wanted something even greater than that. We'll get to that.  \n \nBut the first thing the Lord said was that \"You will rule the kingdom for 36,000 years. You will \nperform sacrifices. But you will remember Me. There will be no obstacles in your service as \nKing. You will remember the goal of your sacrifices.\" \n \nThe Lord detailed how Dhruva will rule his father's kingdom. After that, he will have a kingdom \neven better than Lord Brahma's. He will have his own planet, the polestar within this universe. \nWhen all planets in this universe are destroyed at the time of universal devastation, the \npolestar will remain. So ultimately he would rule a kingdom even better than Lord Brahma's.  \n \nIn addition, the Lord also told Dhruva, \"Your stepbrother will go to the forest to hunt and he will \nbe killed. Your stepmother, when she hears that her son has been killed in the forest, out of \ngreat despair, she will enter into the forest to look for her son and she will be devoured by a \nforest fire.\"  \n \nThese points were spoken directly to Dhruva by the Lord. And then the Lord departed.  \n\n \nAlthough Dhruva got the fulfillment of his desires, he was lamenting. \"What is the value of \nthose desires in relation to what I just experienced in the darshan of the Lord?\"  \n \nAdditionally, when the Lord appeared to Dhruva, Dhruva became so overwhelmed, he offered \nprayers to glorify the Lord. In those prayers which he personally composed, he asked for only \none benediction from the Lord. \"Please let me always be in the association of Your devotees.\" \n \nHowever, the Lord departed without saying anything about his new request. Visvanath \nCakravarti Thakur explains that that was the reason why Dhruva Maharaja was thrown into \nlamentation even though he got the darshan of the Lord. Dhruva realized that, \"The Lord \nfulfilled all of my previous desires, but He didn't respond to what I said when I saw Him.\" \nDhruva was therefore condemning himself, saying, \"I have prayed only for useless things. My \nactivities were exactly like treatment given to a person who is already dead.\" (SB 4.9.34) \n \nAnyway, Dhruva Maharaja received the fulfilment of his desires. After ruling his father's \nkingdom for 36,000 years, when it was time for him to go to his next destination, a flower \nairplane descended from Vaikuntha. Death personified appeared before him. Death personified \nis a very fearful personality to behold. Most living beings do not know how to deal with this \npersonality. But what did Dhruva Maharaja do? He stepped on the head of death personified \nand used his head as a step to get into the flower airplane to go back to Godhead. \n \nIn this connection, Narada Muni gives the analogy how lightning and illumination appear \nsimultaneously. Death is also like that for those who are fully absorbed in thinking of Krsna. This \nis how important it is to be engaged fully in devotional service. In that state of consciousness, \none is prepared to meet death personified. The transition becomes easier for a devotee fully \nengaged in devotional service.  \n \nIn summary, Dhruva Maharaja got the fulfillment of his desires. Because he worshipped the \nLord and faithfully chanted the mantra given to him by Narada Muni, he ultimately went back \nto Godhead. \n \nLord Siva is telling the Pracetas the same thing, \"Chant this prayer I've given to you, be fixed in \ndevotional service, and one can acquire whatever he wants from the Lord.\" \n \nIn an earlier chapter, it is stated,  \n \n\"A devotee who rises early in the morning and with folded hands chants these prayers sung by \nLord Siva and gives facility to others to hear them certainly becomes free from all bondage to \nfruitive activities.\" (SB 4.24.78) \n \n\"My dear sons of the King, the prayers I have recited to you are meant for pleasing the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead, the Supersoul. I advise you to recite these prayers, which are as \neffective as great austerities.\" (SB 4.24.79) \n\n \nThe Pracetas, received and accepted these prayers. They then performed austerities for 10,000 \nyears while meditating on these prayers that were given to them by Lord Siva. \n \nAfter performing their austerities and chanting this prayer, the Lord appeared to the Pracetas. \nThe Lord, being very pleased by their austerities, spoke an often-quoted verse expressing His \npleasure with the Pracetas' austerities.  \n \n\"The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear sons of the King, I am very much pleased \nby the friendly relationships among you. All of you are engaged in one occupation -- devotional \nservice. I am so pleased with your mutual friendship that I wish you all good fortune. Now you \nmay ask a benediction of Me.\" (SB 4.30.8) \n \nThis is the verse where Srila Prabhupada speaks about unity in devotional service in his purport.  \n \n\"The Lord continued: Those who remember you every evening of every day will become \nfriendly with their brothers and with all other living entities. (SB 4.30.9) \n \nThe Pracetas also offered prayers to the Lord. This is proper... to begin with glorification. We \nshould not just ask for the fulfillment of our desires. Neither does a devotee think, \"If I glorify \nthe Lord I'll get a better chance of getting my desire fulfilled.\" A devotee glorifies the Lord \nbecause he has understood the true glories of the Lord, and therefore he glorifies the Lord's \nqualities, His beauty, His characteristics, His dealings with devotees, His opulences, etc..  \n \nIn addition, in their prayers, the Pracetas requested, ...\"we pray that You will be satisfied with \nus. That is our benediction. We do not desire anything other than Your full satisfaction.\" (SB \n4.30.30) \n \nAnd their other request was: \n \n\"Dear Lord, as long as we have to remain within this material world due to our material \ncontamination and wander from one type of body to another and from one planet to another, \nwe pray that we may associate with those who are engaged in discussing Your pastimes. We \npray for this benediction life after life, in different bodily forms and on different planets.\" (SB \n4.30.33) \n \nWhy do we read, again and again, that devotees who are in the presence of the Lord, pray, \"Let \nme have the association of Your devotees?\" There must be a certain special quality of devotees \nthat inspires devotees to ask the Lord, \"Let me be in the association of Your devotees.\" \n \nThe devotee thinks, \"If I could be in the association of devotees who are always glorifying You, \nthen I'm protected. I'll never be able to forget You.\" That is what a devotee wants. Under all \ncircumstances, he wants to be able to remember the Lord. A devotee thinks, \"If I'm in the \nassociation of devotees who are always glorifying You, how can I forget You?\" \n\n \nThere are so many verses which give emphasis to the value of devotee association. \nIn fact it was Narada Muni who said to King Pracinibarhisat, the father of the Pracetas:  \n \n\"My dear King, in the place where pure devotees live, following the rules and regulations and \nthus purely conscious and engaged with great eagerness in hearing and chanting the glories of \nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, in that place if one gets a chance to hear their constant \nflow of nectar, which is exactly like the waves of a river, one will forget the necessities of life -- \nnamely hunger and thirst -- and become immune to all kinds of fear, lamentation and illusion.\" \n(SB 4.29.39–40) \n \nNarada Muni was giving King Pracinabarhisat good instruction. When Narada Muni first visited \nthe king he was trying to get him to give up his attachment to fruitive activities. He told the \nallegorical story of King Puranjana in an attempt to convince him to give up his attachments. \nAfter hearing about Puranjana and then receiving further instruction from Narada Muni, the \nKing achieved liberation and then the story of King Pracinabarhisat was finished. Vidura then \nasked Maitreya, \"Can you go back to the Pracetas? What happened to them? What did they \nachieve?\" \n \nSo as we were explaining before, the Pracetas got the darshan of the Lord. The Lord asked them \nfor a benediction and their only requests were, \"We ask that you be satisfied by our devotional \nservice and that we have the association of devotees.\" \n \nLet us remember, however, that they were performing austerities under the request of their \nfather who told them to prepare for householder life. So they wanted to fulfill the desire of \ntheir father. So what did the Lord tell them? He said that, \"Because you are all united in \ndevotional service, you will all have your own kingdoms.\" \n \nImagine, each of them having their own kingdoms with no quarreling amongst themselves. The \nLord said, \"You will always have friendly relationships with your brothers and friendly \nrelationships towards all living entities.\" And then He told them, \"You will rule those kingdoms \nfor one million years.\" A million years! Of course, it's a million of our years. In celestial years, it \nwould be less. \n \nAs the Lord told Prahlada Maharaja, He similarly told the Pracetas, \"You will always be engaged \nin sacrifice. I'll be satisfied by your sacrifices so that you will not forget the actual goal.\" \n \nSometimes one may think that, \"Once one gets the darshan of the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead one soon goes back to Godhead.\" It's like the happy ending of the story. He gets the \ndarshan of the Lord and then goes back to Godhead. But here we see in the case of Dhruva \nMaharaja, he remained, reigning over his father's kingdom for 36,000 years. With the \nPracetas... they were ruling over their kingdoms for one million years. But they would perform \ntheir duties in this world without forgetting the Lord.  \n \n\nThat is what Prabhupada explained in his purports, that we perform our duties in this world, we \ntake the mantra which has been given to us, we chant that mantra, obtaining the association of \nthe Lord, and then after performing our duties in this world perfectly in Krsna consciousness, \nwe go back to Godhead.  \n \nIt's how we are supposed to live in this world. It's not that we are all just going to chant and \nwait for the Lord to appear to deliver us. No. We must understand how to perform our duties in \nthis world, especially those duties which have been entrusted to us and take the mantra which \nhas been given to us.  \n \nSrila Prabhupada compared the mantra given to the Pracetas by Lord Siva to receiving the Hare \nKrsna mantra. By performing our duties in Krsna consciousness while chanting the Hare Krsna \nmahamantra, at the appropriate time, all perfection will be there.  \n \nThe point that Srila Prabhupada makes in today's purport is that we should follow the decisions \nmade by those persons who received instructions from the Lord. Following their decisions is as \ngood as receiving instructions from the Lord.  \n \nPrabhupada says, \"One who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know \nthat the highest perfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this \nverse it is indicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracetas, the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is \nthe way of the parampara system. If we follow the acaryas, we attain the same benefit as our \npredecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly \nhearing Bhagavad-gita from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. (SB 4.30.10 Purport) \n \nOne follows the decisions of Arjuna. In other words, by having examples to follow we get \nstrength, courage, enthusiasm and determination to continue to execute our duties in this life.  \n \nWe oftentimes quote Sri Bhaktyaloka. We referred to that quote yesterday.  \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur explains: \n \n\"After receiving initiation and instructions from a bona fide guru, a fortunate disciple should \nfollow the path of the previous sadhus. Those who are proud neglect the previous mahajanas \nand create new paths. As a result, they soon proceed on their inauspicious path and ruin \nthemselves. It is said in the Skanda Purana: \n \nsa mrgyah sreyasam hetuh \npanthah santapa-varjitah \nanavapta-sramam purve \nyena santah pratasthire \n \n\n\"One should strictly follow the easy path which the previous mahajanas have accepted. That \npath bestows great auspiciousness and is devoid of all misery.\" (Sri Bhaktyaloka, Chapter 10) \n  \nWe speak on this point a lot. Actually this is the point I was asked to speak on today. I am just \ngetting to it now. But it's all connected. It's connected to Dhruva Maharaja, it's connected to \nthe Pracetas, it's connected to Haridas Thakur about whom Bhaktivinode Thakur speaks. He \nsays that we have to have examples, our mahajanas, from whom we take shelter. We must try \nto remember their activities and to remember their decisions in order to get strength. \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur continues,  \n \n\"By discussing the path of the previous sadhus, one gets determination, courage, and \nsatisfaction. \n \nWho does Bhaktivinode Thakur use as an example? He uses the example of Haridas Thakur. \nHaridas Thakur's path wasn't such an easy path to follow. But Bhaktivinode Thakur says that by \nremembering his path it becomes easy.  \n \nDoes that mean that we have to beaten through twenty-two marketplaces? Do we have to be \nthreatened to be killed? Persecuted? Haridas Thakur was subjected to so much. He was \ndragged to prison and threatened by the Kazi. He was told to give up his convictions and to stop \nchanting the holy names. Haridas Thakur's response was, \"You can cut my body to pieces but I \nwill never give up chanting the holy name of the Lord.\" \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur explains that Haridas Thakur taught by his example three very important \nprinciples to be followed by those who follow in the footsteps of previous sadhus. The first, is \nthat one must always be determined, in all circumstances, that \"Yes. I must be determined to \nexecute my duties in this world while remembering the Lord.  \n \nThe second is to never give up the chanting of Hare Krishna.  \n \nThe third principle is to be compassionate towards all other living beings. \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur says that this is the path given by our previous acaryas which must be \nfollowed. It's the easy path. What makes it the easy path to follow? Austerities for 10,000 years \nunder the water? This is the easy path to follow? To go to the forest to eat berries and dried   \nleaves, to then give up all eating, by living off breath alone? To perform severe austerities \nstanding on one toe? This is the easy path? To be threatened, to be beaten in twenty-two \nmarketplaces until death? This is the easy path I'm supposed to follow? \n \nBy remembering them or by following their decisions, whatever difficulties or obstacles we \nneed to overcome become easier for us to surrender. Without an example it's very difficult to \ndo something on our own. \n \n\nTherefore Bhaktivinode Thakur says that those who are proud create their own paths.  \n \n\"Those who are proud neglect the previous mahajanas and create new paths. As a result, they \nsoon proceed on their inauspicious path and ruin themselves.\" (Sri Bhaktyaloka, Chapter 10) \n \nIn other words, they have no one to follow for spiritual strength.  \n \nWe accept the path established by our mahajanas as our examples to follow. By remembering \nthem, whatever difficulties we have to undergo become easier. In comparison to them, our \nausterities are small. We make ourselves think that they are just so big, so difficult, impossible \nto overcome. \"How can I ever do it? This is too much.\" \n \nBut by remembering those who made good decisions and who showed by their example how \nthey crossed the ocean of material existence and went back home, back to Godhead, we get \nstrength, courage, determination and enthusiasm. It makes it easier. That's how it becomes the \neasy path. \n \nIn this regard, I've been telling devotees recently a very practical story I experienced. It means a \nlot to me. It moves my heart. It's what gave me strength. I'm sure that many have heard this \nstory, but I'll tell it again. I love telling it.  \n \nSarvajna dasa: About Sridhara Maharaja?  \n \nYes Sridhara Maharaja. It's such a perfect example. By remembering Sridhara Maharaja, I got \nstrength. We had a previous friendly relationship with each other before he came to Mayapura \nin 2004. When Sridhara Maharaja came to Mayapura, he understood he would soon be leaving \nthis world. He had two desires he wanted fulfilled before departing. He wanted to go to \nMayapura to take part in the installation of Panca Tattva and he wanted to be with his \ngodbrothers.  \n \nHe expressed those desires when he was told by Canadian doctors that he couldn't receive a \nliver transplant because the cancer had spread too far in his body. From Canada, he met \nIndradyumna Maharaja in London and then the two of them came together to Mayapura.  \n \nSridhara Maharaja liked my kirtans. One time when Sridhara Maharaja was staying in a \ndevotee's flat near Bhaktivedanta Hospital at the same time I was being treated in \nBhaktivedanta Hospital, Sridhara Maharaja called me and asked, \"Maharaja can you come over \nand chant with me?\" He was not terminally ill at that time. But he was having a lot of health \nproblems. He was staying in an apartment trying to recover from an earlier treatment.  \n \nSo as soon as I had an opportunity I went over and visited Maharaja. When I arrived I expressed \nhow happy I was to see him. The first thing he said to me was, \"You see that harmonium over \nthere? Can we chant?\" It was just myself and Sridhara Maharaja. The two of us just sat and had \nkirtan together. \n\n \nAnother time when he was in Bombay, Maharaja asked again if I could come. But I couldn't go \nthat time. I believe he was again staying someplace near the hospital in Bombay but I was in \nPune at the Pune Yatra. From Pune I had to immediately go someplace else. So I asked \nMaharaja to forgive me. I told him I couldn't come that time but next time I would definitely \nmake the time to visit and chant together with him. \n \nThe next time I saw Maharaja was in Mayapura. A large group of devotees assembled to receive \nhim. It was a wonderful reception. There's a little funny story in this connection. When \nMaharaja arrived he had all this red around his mouth. It looked like it was blood. When the \ndevotees saw him they were shocked, but nobody wanted to say anything. They came down \nand sat in the room with Sridhara Maharaja who then said, \"I was eating red candy.\"  \n \nAnyway, when I saw Sridhara Maharaja, I embraced him and I said, \"Sridhara Maharaja I'm just \nso happy to see you.\" One of Maharaja's desires was also to have was kirtan in his room every \nnight. So when I embraced Maharaja I just said, \"Maharaja if you want me, I'm available 24/7.\"    \n \nAs it turned out, Sridhara Maharaja did take part in the abhiseka. There are many pictures of \nhim bathing Lord Caitanya during the Panca Tattva abhiseka. He was so absorbed. After the \ndeities were installed Sridhara Maharaja was more or less restricted to his room. It was then \nwhen he had devotees come to his room every evening for kirtan.  \n \nMaharaja was oftentimes lying during these evening kirtans. He couldn't get up. His body was \nswollen, although he had a way of dismissing these things. Sridhara Maharaja was known as the \n\"Jolly Swami.\" He was happy to be in the association of devotees. Sometimes his stomach \nwould swell up with fluids and the doctors had to come in to remove the fluids from his \nstomach. His brothers and a couple of other devotees were there one time when the doctors \ncame in to do the procedure. Sridhara Maharaja turned to the doctor and said, \"It's a boy.\" \n \nAnyway, Maharaja's room was full of devotees, every night. Sridhara Maharaja, because he was \nlying in bed, would oftentimes dance with his arms because he couldn't get up to sit with the \ndevotees. He would say, \"Forgive me, I can't dance, but I'm dancing with you with my arms.\"  \n \nOne night, after the GBC meetings, I had a terrible headache. I was thinking, \"I don't know if I \ncan go to the kirtan tonight with this bad headache.\" I was of two minds. \"I told Sridhara \nMaharaja that I would be there every night, but maybe tonight is an exception.\" \n \nSo after the meeting, I wrote note to Mayapura dasa, Sridhara Maharaja's secretary. I wrote \nsomething like, \"Mayapura, could you please tell Sridhara Maharaja to forgive me. I'm not \ncoming this evening. I have a terrible headache. I'm going back to my room.\" At that time I was \nstaying in the Vaisnava Academy. I had to walk a bit of a distance from the meetings to the \nacademy. While I was walking to the academy, I started to think of Sridhara Maharaja. \"Wait a \nminute. Sridhara Maharaja is lying in bed with a terminal illness, having kirtan. He's in pain. \nWhat is my headache compared to what he is going through? I have a headache. But Sridhara \n\nMaharaja is dancing with his arms with the devotees in kirtan, and I have a little headache.\" \n \nWhile meditating on that, I started to think, \"Oh I better turn around. I better go back.\" What \nseemed to be very significant became insignificant by meditating on his example. I got strength \nfrom that example. So I went back, directly to Sridhara Maharaja's room. I opened up the door, \nstood in the doorway, and the room was full as it always was. I didn't want to go in because I \ndidn't want to step over any of the devotees. But Sridhara Maharaja looked up and saw me. He \nhad received the message from Mayapura. Maharaja looked at me and said, \"Come here.\" And I \nsaid, \"Maharaja, I don't want to disrupt all of the devotees.\" And Sridhara Maharaja said, \"No. \nCome here.\" And he told the devotees. \"Make room for Niranjana Swami.\" \n \nSo, I had to follow his instructions. He's my superior. I had no idea what was coming next. He \nsat up on the bed and said, \"Sit here.\" I was thinking, \"He is going to ask me to give a lecture?\" I \nhad no idea. So I sat down and I didn't know what's next. I don't remember if there was a kirtan \nat the time but I remember feeling like I was the center of attention. I was thinking, \"What's \nSridhara Maharaja going to do?\" \n \nSridhara Maharaja turns to his servant, Mayapura dasa, and says, \"Mayapura, give me the Tiger \nBalm.\" Do you know what Tiger Balm is? He took the Tiger Balm in his hands and said, \"Look at \nme.\" He took the Tiger Balm and started to massage my forehead with it. He just kept on \nmassaging my forehead. It went on for some time. The devotees resumed the kirtan and he was \njust massaging my forehead.  \n \nMaharaja was thinking of my headache. That's a Vaisnava. How can you not love such a \nVaisnava. Here he was thinking of my headache. Such compassion. Absorbed in the holy name. \nDetermined to be in the association of devotees. This is the path we follow. We don't just have \nto go to Bhagavatam to find examples. We can find so many examples in our lives of devotees \nwho are determined to serve under all circumstances. \n \nAnother example...I was just in Boston. There's a godbrother there of mine whose name is \nMukta Vandya dasa. He's a very simple-hearted devotee. He's always engaged in service. He's \nhad two heart attacks. He had one heart attack when he was living in Gita Nagari. He used to \nsell flowers every day in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which is about an hour away from Gita \nNagari. He was married at the time. He worked very hard selling flowers, but he would use \npractically all of the money he earned for the temple. In fact, he was sleeping in a small tool \nshed filled with tools.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu wasn't thinking about accummulating money for himself. He was just \nthinking about how to accummulate money for Radha Damodara and serve the temple. He \nwould work very hard. He'd work so hard that one day he had a heart attack on his way to \nwork. Krsna arranged that he had the heart attack while driving right close to the home of a \nperson who was his auto mechanic. When his mechanic saw him, he immediately knew what \nwas happening and called the hospital. He then had to be airlifted by a helicopter and was \ntaken to another hospital. They saved him. They put whatever they had to put in him. I believe \n\nit was a stent or something like that to open up the blockage.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu gradually recovered and continued to work. He was working a little bit \neasier though. After some time, he got rid of his home when his wife moved elsewhere. So he \nstayed in the basement of the temple building in a little corner. He kept all of his belongings \nthere. He continued to work every day selling flowers and continued to give his profits to the \ntemple.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu always wore very simple clothing. The van he drove for his flower \nbusiness was not very fancy. Unfortunately he had a second heart attack. By that time I was \nalready telling him. \"Mukta, you've got to slow down. You need to take care of your body. It's \nKrsna's body. It's not your body.\" He's loved by so many devotees. He's just a simple-hearted \ndevotee who always just wants to serve. \n \nNow Mukta Vandya Prabhu lives in the Boston temple. He's careful now not to push himself too \nhard. But he's still ready to do any service that needs to be done. He's just fully engaged in \nservice. If somebody comes to the temple, he preaches to them. He has no formal position. He \nhas a little room on the second floor of the temple. Whenever guests come to the temple, they \nalways go to see Mukta. He's the friend of everybody.  \n \nIf there's nobody to give class, Mukta Vandya will go downstairs to give Bhagavad-gita class. If \nthere's nobody to cook the offering, Mukta Vandya will be the first person to run down and \ncook for Radha Gopivallabha. \n \nThe day before I left Boston, one had to leave for Croatia because his father passed away. There \nwas nobody to buy all of the bhoga for a big feast for a big ceremony the temple was having the \nnext day. I arrived at the temple and came through back door of the temple. Mukta Vandya was \nstanding there by a van full of bhoga. He had gone to purchase all the bhoga for the feast with \nanother devotee who went with him to help to carry all of it. There was nobody to buy it, \nMukta Vandya just went out to do it. \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu always goes and buys flowers for the deities. Everybody who knows him \nat the flower market loves him. Sometimes he's given thousands of dollars worth of flowers for \nfree. He's the friend of everybody. Ajata satru. He just wants to serve. He's careful. He doesn't \npush his body. He knows his limits. \n \nOnce every month for a few days he goes to serve Satsvarupa das Goswami. He took first \ninitiation from Srila Prabhpuada but second initiation from Satsvarupa das Goswami. So he goes \nthere just so that he can have an opportunity to serve.  \n \nI was telling the story the other night about Vaisnava Prema. Who was going to see Vaisnava \nPrema practically every day? Who took care of all of the arrangements for him? It was Mukta \nVandya. It was Mukta Vandya who told me the story which I shared with all of you the other \nday. When I asked Mukta Vandya, \"Is Vaisnava Prema in pain?\" He told me, \"I can't say for sure. \n\nWhen I was there two days ago, he was crying although he appeared to be asleep. He didn't \nknow I was there. He was speaking aloud though and was saying, \"How beautiful Vrndavana is.\" \nSo I don't know if he was crying from the pain or if he was crying because he was seeing the \nbeauty of Vrndavana.  \n \nIt was Mukta Vandya who made all of the arrangements after Vaisnava Prema departed. He \nalso visits another devotees whose name is Dina Dayal. He is currently in a nursing home. He \ngoes and brings him prasadam to him all of the time. Mukta Vandya lives for service.  \n \nWhy should we not meditate on such examples? Those who lives for service. This is good \nintelligence. This is the way to go back to Godhead. The way to go back to Godhead is to be \nabsorbed in service. Those who are absorbed in service are making the best preparation for \ngoing back to Godhead. When we think of them, we get strength, courage, enthusiasm and \nsatisfaction. We should be looking for such examples in our life. And, as Srila Prabhupada says \nin today's purport, which should look at their good decisions. This is parampara. This is what it \nmeans to follow in the footsteps of those who are teaching by their example how to make the \nright decisions to be engaged in devotional service.  \n \nHowever long they may have to live in this world, they'll continue living in this world \nperforming their duties. And to get both the fulfillment of their desires and good intelligence.  \n \nPrabhupada says, \"Good intelligence means to go back home, back to Godhead.\" This is what \nwe can learn from those who serve as examples. We should relish hearing about these \nexamples. These examples bring devotional service to life. It makes it real. It gives us a purpose \nfor living in this world. And it gives us a goal to achieve at the end of this life. \n \nThis is what Srila Prabhupada has instructed in this verse about the Pracetas. \n \nI'll read the verse again and then we will end.  \n \nThose who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence.\" \n \nI'm sorry I went a little bit late, but I hope the message was clear. Hare Krsna. \n \n ","attachment_name":"transcription_sb_4.30.10_english.pdf","attachment_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/sites/default/files/attachments/transcription_sb_4.30.10_english.pdf"},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"ru":{"title":"11 августа, 2018 - Ретрит учеников - Магдалиновка - Ш.Б. 4.30.10 - Английский/ Русский","event":"Retreat","topic":"Шримад Бхагаватам","translation":"Русский","location":"Magdalinivka","transcription":{"text":"","attachment_name":""},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"counters":{"audio_page_view":0,"audio_play_count":0,"downloads":"129","video_page_view":0,"en_transcription_view":0,"ru_transcription_view":0,"en_summary_view":0,"ru_summary_view":0}},{"uuid":"1f8bcffa-5bd8-42c3-b89d-081bfb0e3fe4","needs_translation":true,"created_date":"2018-08-26","published_date":"","author":"Niranjana Swami","part":"7","chapter":"15","verse":"45","download_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/download/33355","lecture_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/en/lecture/26495","duration":"01:37:59","downloads":"147","audio_link":"https://nrs-site.s3.amazonaws.com/lectures/2018/2018-08/niranjana_swami_-_sb_7.15.45_on_balarama-purnima_-c2a0almaty_26-aug-2018.mp3","soundCloud_link":"https://soundcloud.com/niranjana-swami/august-26-2018-almaty","youtube":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsg2S32qsdM?rel=gallery-all&wmode=opaque&autoplay=0"],"en":{"title":"August 26, 2018 - Almaty, Kazakhstan - Balarama Purnima Class - English/ Russian","event":"Festival","topic":"Srimad Bhagavatam","translation":"Russian","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"\n\nTranscription of a Lecture Given on Balarama Purnima, August 26, 2018, in Almaty, Kazakhstan\nThe following is a partially-edited lecture given in Almaty, Kazakhstan on Balarama Purnima, August \n26, 2018\nToday we are observing the appearance of Lord Balarama. I will first speak about, \"Who is Lord \nBalarama?.\" I will then speak on a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam in which Srila Prabhupada speaks \nabout the necessity of getting spiritual strength from Lord Balarama.\nLord Balarama is the first expansion of Lord Krsna called a svamsa expansion. There's very little \ndifference between Krsna and Balarama. They are both the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nSome of the differences are that is Krsna is blackish like the monsoon raincloud and Balarama is white.\nKrsna plays a flute and Balarama plays a buffalo horn. Sometimes Balarama carries a flute but most \noften He carries a buffalo horn in Vrndavana. Balarama sometimes carries a plow and club.\nBalarama manifested in Vrndavana as Krsna's elder brother. He first appeared in the womb of Devaki \nand later, by the arrangement of Yogamaya, He was transferred to the womb on Rohini. In Vrndavana, \nBalarama is known as Rohininandana, the son of Rohini.\nOutside of Vrndavana, Lord Balarama is manifest as Mula-sankarsana. Mula-sankarsana is the first \nexpansion coming from Lord Balarama. When Lord Balarama appeared in Vrndavana in the womb of \nRohini, this Mula-sankarsana became drawn to Him and appeared within Him. This is explained in \nGopal Campu. Just as Krsna never leaves Vrndavana, Balarama never leaves Vrndavana.\nFrom Lord Balarama manifests His plenary expansions beginning with Mula-sankarsana. As Mula-\nsankarsana, Balarama is manifest outside of Vrndavana in Mathura and Dwaraka.\nFrom Balarama also comes all living entities. Even the nitya-siddhas in the spiritual world, all of \nKrsna's devotees who are either in santa rasa, dasya rasa, sakyha rasa or vatsalya rasa are all coming \nfrom Lord Balarama. Vrndavana is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama. In fact, the whole \ndhama is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama.\nSo Balarama serves Krsna by providing all this for Krsna's pleasure in the spiritual world. Those in \nconjugal rasa, the gopis, are expansions coming from Srimati Radharani.\nIn this way, all of Krsna's eternal associates, Krsna parisada, are manifestations coming from either \nLord Balarama or Srimati Radharani in the spiritual world.\nMula-sankarsana further expands as Maha-sankarsana. As Maha-sankarsana He becomes the source of \nall of the living entities who are serving Krsna in Vaikuntha.\nWhen we say, \"From Lord Balarama comes\", it suggests that at one time, within time, the living entities\nmanifested from Lord Balarama. But we should know that being under the influence of material time, \nthese things are difficult to conceive in the material world.\n\nFor instance, Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita to Arjuna, \"Never was there a time when you did not exist, \nnever was there a time when all these kings assembled in the battlefield did not exist, never was there a \ntime when I did not exist, nor in the future will any of us cease to be.\" (BG 2.12)\nSo when we say that the living entities are all emanations or expansions coming from Lord Balarama, \nimmediately we have a tendency to think, \"Oh at some point in time, they manifested.\" However, they \nare all eternally manifest.\nJust as Krsna, as stated in Brahma Samhita, is beginningless. Lord Brahma says that Krsna is advaitam \nacyutam, anadim, ananta-rupam. He is nondual. His body is never subject to decay. He is the \nbeginning. He has no end. He is the source of everything. So beginningless means, never was there a \ntime when He did not exist.\nIn the same way, never was there a time when Lord Balarama did not exist. Never was there a time \nwhen all of Krsna's eternal associates did not exist, and the living entities, the jivas, never was there a \ntime when they did not exist. Krsna's energies are always existing simultaneously along with Krsna.\nJust like this material world goes through cycles. It's manifest, it stays for some time and then \nunmanifest. But this manifestation and unmanifestation is an eternal process without beginning or end.\nIf I give you a little time to think about it— just a little time. Never was there a time when Krsna, \nBalarama, the living entities did not exist. This cannot be understood by the limited mind. As long as \nwe are under the influence of time, it is very difficult to understand that which is existing in eternal \ntime.\nKrsna says \"the spiritual world is unmanifest, infallible, and it is the supreme destination. When one \ngoes there he never has to come back. \"When Krsna says that the spiritual world is unmanifest, does it \nmean that it doesn't exist? No. Never was there a time when it manifested. It's eternal. And Krsna says \nthat when one goes there, he never comes back. Tad dhama paramam mama. \"That is My supreme \nabode.\" (BG 8.21)\nSo, as we said, Balarama is the first expansion coming from Krsna. But when did Balarama expand \nfrom Krsna? And when did Maha-sankarsana, Mula-sankarsana expand from the original Balarama? \nAnd when from the Mula-sankarsana did Maha-sankarsana manifest in order to manifest the Vaikuntha \nplanets and all of Krsna's servants in the Vaikuntha planets who serve Him in His various forms? We \ncannot say when it happened. We only use those terms because we think in those terms. And we won't \nbe able to fully understand until we go beyond the influence of time ourselves. Those who are beyond \nthe influence of time, for them, time is ever-present. Krsna's pastimes and Balarama's pastimes in the \nspiritual world are eternally manifest.\nTime is also manifest in the spiritual world. But there it exists to assist Krsna and Balarama in Their \npastimes. There is no destructive feature of time in the spiritual world.\nEvery morning, Krsna, Balarama, and Their cowherd boyfriends after breakfast and milking the cows, \ngo out to the pastures. During the day when the sun is fully manifest in the sky, They along with the \ncowherd boys take shelter in the caves of Govardhana. As the sun continues to pass, later in the evening\nKrsna and Balarama with Their cowherd boyfriends and the cows, return to Gokula.\n\n2\nIn the spiritual world, time is manifest just to assist Krsna in His pastimes. But there is no destructive \nfeature of time as time destroys everything in the material world.\nKrsna tells Arjuna when He manifested the universal form, \"kalo 'smi loka-ksaya-krt pravrddho\", Time \nI am, the great destroyer of the worlds.\" (BG 11.32)\nSo when Krsna creates this material world, first He creates time. That's how creation takes place. \nOtherwise how could creation take place if there was no time? So when it's time for unmanifested \nmaterial elements to manifest as the external energy, time first appears.\nThen from Maha-sankarsana, as we said, in the spiritual world comes Karanadakasayi Visnu, who is \nalso a manifestation of Lord Balarama. And from Karandakasayi Visnu comes Garbodakasayi Visnu \nwho enters into each universe, which are generated from Karanadakasayi Visnu. And from \nGarbodakasayi Visnu who lies in the Garbodaka Ocean, comes the first created being in the universe, \nLord Brahma.\nThey are all expansions coming from Lord Balarama. Then there is Ksirodakasayi Visnu, who is also \nthe supersoul, manifested in the heart of all living beings. After the manifestation of Ksirodakasayi \nVisnu, comes Sesa who is a manifestation of the Lord who serves the Lord in various ways in this \nworld.\nAnanta-sesa, on each of His hoods, holds material universes. That's spiritual strength. Imagine holding \nunlimited universes on your hoods, and you standing on nothing? Try to conceive. It's inconceivable.\nSo Ananta-sea is holding all the universes on his different hoods but he rests on nothing. He is self-\nsufficient. And He is a manifestation of Lord Balarama.\nThere are two manifestations of Sesa. There's Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods, and \nthen there is the Ananta-sesa who is the bed of Lord Visnu. In the Laghu-bhagavatamrita Rupa \nGoswami explains that the Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods is an avesa avatara of \nLord Balarama. He is saktyavesa. He's an empowered jiva who holds the universe on his heads as \nAnanta-sesa.\nThe other manifestation of Sesa is a plenary expansion of Lord Balarama upon whom Lord Visnu lies.\nAnanta-sesa serves Lord Krsna, just as Lord Balarama is serving Lord Krsna in all of these different \nforms in the matter of creation and maintenance of this cosmic manifestation. Ananta-sesa is also \nmanifest as Krsna's pillow, Krsna's shoes, Krsna's bed, Krsna's sacred thread, Krsna's garments, etc.. In \nthis way, Ananta-sesa is rendering service to Krsna.\nSo Lord Balarama, in His different manifestations, is rendering service to Krsna in unlimited ways. \nEven though Lord Balarama is Krsna Himself, He is always absorbed in the mood of, \"I am Krsna's \nservant.\"\nLord Balarama's service mood towards Krsna is described as sankula, or mixed. He is Krsna's friend. \nKrsna goes out with his cowherd boyfriends. Lord Balarama is going with Him into the pasturing \n\ngrounds. He's Krsna's servant as we already described in various ways how Lord Balarama renders \nservice to Krsna. And He also has a mood of vatsalya, because He is Krsna's older brother.\nIn Vedic culture, ancient culture, the older brother is always worshipped and respected as one's \nsuperior. So Balarama also has this vatsalya mood of protecting Krsna.\nWhen Balarama and Krsna entered into the forest of Dhenukasura, Krsna spoke about Lord Balarama \nas follows:\n\"O greatest of Lords, just see how these trees are bowing their heads at Your lotus feet, which are \nworshipable by the immortal demigods. The trees are offering You their fruits and flowers to eradicate \nthe dark ignorance that has caused their birth as trees.\" (SB 10.15.5)\nSo Krsna is considering Balarama His superior. In the forest of Dhenukasura, Balarama is lying down \nwith His head on the lap of the cowherd boys and Krsna is taking Balarama's lotus feet and is \nmassaging them. So Balarama also serves Krsna in this vatsalya mood and is treated as a superior by \nKrsna. Balarama also serves Krsna in madhurya-rasa. But to do that, He is manifested as Ananga-\nmanjari, the sister of Radharani.\nBalarama is also considered Adi-guru. Adi-guru means the original guru. Just as Krsna treats Balarama \nas a superior, He also treats Him as guru. Balarama is akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda means unlimited. \nIn other words, Balarama is the guru that manifests in unlimited forms to serve as guru. And all gurus \nare understood to be representatives of Lord Balarama, who is the source of spiritual strength.\nPrabhupada explains in Krsna book. \"In the Upanisad it is stated, nayam atma bala-hinena labhyah. The\npurport is that one cannot attain the supreme platform of self-realization without being sufficiently \nfavored by Balarama. Bala does not mean physical strength. No one can attain spiritual perfection by \nphysical strength. One must have the spiritual strength which is infused by Balarama, or Sankarsana. \nAnanta, or Sesa, is the power which sustains all the planets in their different positions. Materially this \nsustaining power is known as the law of gravitation, but actually it is a display of the potency of \nSankarsana. Balarama, or Sankarsana, is spiritual power, or the original spiritual master. Therefore \nLord Nityananda Prabhu, who is also the incarnation of Balarama, is the original spiritual master. And \nthe spiritual master is the representative of Balarama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who \nsupplies spiritual strength. In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is confirmed that the spiritual master is the \nmanifestation of the mercy of Krsna.\" (Krsna Book Ch. 2)\nSo Prabhupada refers to the verse from the Mundaka Upanisad.\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvan\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nThis verse means, \"The Supreme Lord cannot be attained by one who has no spiritual strength, one \nwho is careless or wild, or whose austerites are inappropriate. The Lord appears before a person who \nstrives by the right means to attain Him. Such a person enters the spiritual world.\"\n\nOne requires spiritual strength in order to understand Krsna and to enter the spiritual world. \nPrabhupada says that we are not talking about physical strength. Spiritual strength is the strength to \novercome the influence of the modes of material nature, to cross the ocean of material existence, and to\nbecome qualified to enter into that supreme abode which is unmanifest and infallible.\nWho is the source of spiritual strength? It is Balarama who is akhanda guru tattva. He manifests \nHimself in various forms in order to give strength to the living entities in the material world so they can\nfind the determination, courage, and satisfaction to overcome the stringent laws of material nature and \nto achieve entrance into that eternal abode.\nAs the Mundaka Upanisad says, \"Krsna manifests Himself to that person who strives to achieve Him \nby the right means.\" What is the right means?\nThat is the verse we wanted to read today from Srimad Bhagavatam. This verse speaks about the right \nmeans to cross the ocean of material existence, by getting strength from the spiritual master and \npredecessor spiritual masters.\nHow can we overcome the illusory energy by our own strength? A devotee never thinks, \"I am \nspiritually strong by my own endeavors.\" He knows that whatever spiritual strength he has, has been \ngiven to him because he is taking shelter of spiritual strength.\nJust as one takes shelter of Krsna consciousness,\nkrsna -- surya-sama, maya haya andhakara\nyahan krsna, tahan nahi mayara adhikara\n\"Krsna is compared to sunshine, and maya is compared to darkness. Wherever there is sunshine, there \ncannot be darkness. As soon as one takes to Krsna consciousness, the darkness of illusion (the influence\nof the external energy) will immediately vanish. (Madhya 22.31)\nWherever there is Krsna, there cannot be maya. Wherever there is Krsna consciousness, there cannot be\nthe influence of illusion. But we cannot manifest Krsna before us by our own strength.\nSrimad Bhagavatam states:\nathapi te deva padambuja-dvaya-\nprasada-lesanugrhita eva hi\njanati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno\nna canya eko 'pi ciram vicinvan\nMy Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the \ngreatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years. (SB \n10.14.29)\nUnless one gets that drop of mercy he cannot understand.\n3\nKrsna tells Arjuna,\n\nMy dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before \nyou, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My \nunderstanding. (Bg 11.54)\nTherefore the knowledge and strength to cross over the material existence is coming from Krsna and \nBalarama. Balarama is Adi-guru, the original guru, He is the original source of all spiritual strength. If \none wishes to get spiritual strength, he must take shelter of guru and as this verse we are going to read \ntoday says, our predecessor gurus.\nSo this is the verse and purport that I am going to read in this connection. It's the 7th Canto of Srimad \nBhagavatam, 15th chapter, 45th verse.\nyavan nr-kaya-ratham atma-vasopakalpam\ndhatte garistha-caranarcanaya nisatam\njnanasim acyuta-balo dadhad asta-satruh\nsvananda-tusta upasanta idam vijahyat\nTRANSLATION\nAs long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and paraphernalia, which are \nnot fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, namely his spiritual \nmaster and the spiritual master's predecessors. By their mercy, one can sharpen the sword of \nknowledge, and with the power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's mercy one must then \nconquer the enemies mentioned above. In this way, the devotee should be able to merge into his \nown transcendental bliss, and then he may give up his body and resume his spiritual identity.\nThis verse refers to the enemies mentioned in the previous verse. So in order to more fully understand \nwhat this verse is talking about one should know what these enemies are. And this is the previous verse.\nIn the conditioned stage, one's conceptions of life are sometimes polluted by passion and \nignorance, which are exhibited by attachment, hostility, greed, lamentation, illusion, fear, \nmadness, false prestige, insults, fault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, \nbewilderment, hunger and sleep. All of these are enemies. Sometimes one's conceptions are also \npolluted by goodness. (SB 7.15.43–44)\nIs there anyone who thinks that these enemies that we've listed have all been conquered? I'll read them \none more time.\nAttachment. One by one. Hostility. Greed. Lamentation, illusion, fear, madness, false prestige, insult, \nfault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, bewilderment, hunger, sleep. All of these are \nenemies.\nBy the strength of our own intelligence, to some degree, we may be able to deal with some of these \nenemies. But Prabhupada is going to make the point very clear in the purport that simply by knowledge\nitself one cannot cut away from these enemies.\nKrsna says clearly that the living entities in the material world are struggling very hard with material \nexistence. None of us can say, \"I'm not struggling with these things.\".\n\nOftentimes devotees ask me how to deal with the fact that they are struggling with Krsna \nconsciousness. I say to them, \"You're struggling?! It's good that you're struggling. As soon as you stop \nstruggling you're finished.\" If we're struggling it means that we want to overcome these bad influences. \nThose who don't want to overcome them, think it's natural to be lusty. It's natural to be envious. They \ndon't think they are in illusion because they think illusion is reality.\nWe should therefore struggle to find the spiritual strength to overcome these enemies. That much \nstruggling we have to do. If we don't struggle for that, we'll have to struggle with material nature, \nwhich is very hard on the living entity, and causes so much anxiety.\nPrabhupada says that this material world is kuntha. It is a place of anxiety. It cannot be avoided. \nEverything in this world is temporary and the eternal living entity is going to have to be in anxiety \nabout losing that which he is attached to. So he struggles with this illusory energy.\nA devotee therefore prays. \"Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare/ Hare Rama Hare Rama \nRama Rama Hare Hare.\" He's praying to Krsna. He's praying to Lord Balarama. \"Please give me the \nstrength so that I may be engaged in Krsna's service.\" He's praying to Srimati Radharani. Please engage\nme in Krsna's service. He's looking for strength. This is his struggle.\nSo just as this verse states that \"As long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and\nparaphernalia, which are not fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, \nnamely his spiritual master and the spiritual master's predecessors.\"\nSo let me read the purport. Please take note of the emphasis Srila Prabhupada is making about strength.\nIt's a little bit long. Try to listen carefully.\nIn Bhagavad-gita (4.9) the Lord says:\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\" This is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\nIn other words, this is what it means to accept help from the superiors is to go back home, back to \nGodhead. This is the destination that Krsna wants all living entities to achieve. And Lord Balarama and\nthose in the line of Lord Balarama are meant to give us the strength to go back to the spiritual world.\nThis is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\n... to go back home, back to Godhead.\nIt is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.20.17):\nnr-deham adyam sulabham sudurlabham\nplavam sukalpam guru-karnadharam\n\nmayanukulena nabhasvateritam\npuman bhavabdhim na taret sa atma-ha\nThis human form of body is a most valuable boat, and the spiritual master is the captain, guru-\nkarnadharam, to guide the boat in plying across the ocean of nescience. The instruction of Krsna \nis a favorable breeze. One must use all these facilities to cross over the ocean of nescience. Since \nthe spiritual master is the captain, one must serve the spiritual master very sincerely so that by his\nmercy one will be able to get the mercy of the Supreme Lord.\nA significant word here is acyuta-balah. The spiritual master is certainly very merciful to his \ndisciples, and consequently by satisfying him a devotee gets strength from the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore says, guru-krsna-prasade paya \nbhakti-lata-bija: [Cc. Madhya 19.151] one must first please the spiritual master, and then one \nautomatically pleases Krsna and gets the strength with which to cross the ocean of nescience.\nThis is the point I was making before. Simply knowledge, is insufficient. One can study the Vedas for \nmillions of births, as Lord Brahma says in Brahma Samhita, and still never be able to understand \nKrsna. So it's not simply by knowledge that one can cross the ocean of material existence.\nThe purport continues:\nIf one seriously desires to return home, back to Godhead, one must therefore become strong \nenough by pleasing the spiritual master, for thus one gets the weapon with which to conquer the \nenemy, and one also gets the grace of Krsna. Simply getting the weapon of jnana is insufficient. \nOne must sharpen the weapon by serving the spiritual master and adhering to his instructions. \nThen the candidate will get the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nPrabhupada then gives a nice analogy.\nIn general warfare one must take help from his chariot and horses in order to conquer his enemy, \nand after conquering his enemies he may give up the chariot and its paraphernalia. Similarly, as \nlong as one has a human body, one should fully use it to obtain the highest perfection of life, \nnamely going back home, back to Godhead.\nUsing the human form of life to its full potential.\nkamasya nendriya-pritir\nlabho jiveta yavata\njivasya tattva-jijnasa\nnartho yas ceha karmabhih\nLife's desires should never be directed toward sense gratification. One should desire only a healthy life,\nor self-preservation, since a human being is meant for inquiry about the Absolute Truth. Nothing else \nshould be the goal of one's works. (SB 1.2.10)\nThe perfection of knowledge is certainly to become transcendentally situated (brahma-bhuta [SB \n4.30.20]). As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):\n\nbrahma-bhutah prasannatma\nna socati na kanksati\nsamah sarvesu bhutesu\nmad-bhaktim labhate param\n\"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully \njoyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living \nentities. In that state he attains pure devotional service.\" Simply by cultivating knowledge as the \nimpersonalists do, one cannot get out of the clutches of maya. One must attain the platform of \nbhakti.\nbhaktya mam abhijanati\nyavan yas casmi tattvatah\ntato mam tattvato jnatva\nvisate tad-anantaram\n\"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one \nis in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of \nGod.\" (Bg. 18.55) Unless one has attained the stage of devotional service and the mercy of the \nspiritual master and Krsna, there is a possibility that one may fall down and again accept a \nmaterial body. Therefore Krsna stresses in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\"\nThe word tattvatah, meaning \"in reality,\" is very important. Tato mam tattvato jnatva. Unless one \nunderstands Krsna in truth by the mercy of the spiritual master, one is not free to give up his \nmaterial body.\nIn other words, one has to accept another material body.\n4\nAs it is said, aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah: [SB \n10.2.32] if one neglects to serve the lotus feet of Krsna, one cannot become free from the material\nclutches simply by knowledge. Even if one attains the stage of brahma-padam, merging in \nBrahman, without bhakti he is prone to fall down. One must be very careful in regard to the \ndanger of falling down again into material bondage. The only insurance is to come to the stage of \nbhakti, from which one is sure not to fall. Then one is free from the activities of the material \nworld. In summary, as stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, one must get in touch with a bona fide\nspiritual master coming in the parampara of Krsna consciousness, for by his mercy and \n\ninstructions one is able to get strength from Krsna. Thus one engages in devotional service and \nattains the ultimate goal of life, the lotus feet of Visnu.\nSignificant in this verse are the words jnanasim acyuta-balah. Jnanasim, the sword of knowledge, \nis given by Krsna, and when one serves the guru and Krsna in order to hold the sword of Krsna's \ninstructions, Balarama gives one strength. Balarama is Nityananda. Vrajendra-nandana yei, saci-\nsuta haila sei, balarama ha-ila nitai. This bala -- Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya \nMahaprabhu, and both of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take \nshelter of Their lotus feet. They come especially to deliver the fallen souls of this age, papi tapi \nyata chila, hari-name uddharila. Their weapon is sankirtana, hari-nama. Thus one should accept \nthe sword of knowledge from Krsna and be strong with the mercy of Balarama. We are therefore \nworshiping Krsna-Balarama in Vrndavana. In the Mundaka Upanisad (3.2.4) it is said:\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvams\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nOne cannot attain the goal of life without the mercy of Balarama. Sri Narottama dasa Thakura \ntherefore says, nitaiyera karuna habe, vraje radha-krsna pabe: when one receives the mercy of \nBalarama, Nityananda, one can attain the lotus feet of Radha and Krsna very easily.\nse sambandha nahi yara,   \nbrtha janma gela tara,\nvidya-kule hi karibe tara\nIf one has no connection with Nitai, Balarama, then even though one is a very learned scholar or \njnani or has taken birth in a very respectable family, these assets will not help him. We must \ntherefore conquer the enemies of Krsna consciousness with the strength received from Balarama. \n[end of purport]\nThese enemies are like whips. They are beating us again and again, keeping us in the bodily \nidentification. Imagine living with enemies. We are living with enemies right in our own bodies.\nKrsna described the enemy as lust. When Arjuna asked Krsna, \"What is it Krsna that compels a person \nto act even against his own will?\" Krsna replied that \"It's lust only Arjuna which is later transformed in \nanger, which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world.\" How to conquer this enemy on our own \nstrength?\nThose who try to do it on the strength of their own intelligence,\ntvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\n (SB 10.2.32)\n\n[...]their intelligence is impure. They fall down from their position of imagined superiority because \nthey have no regard for Your lotus feet.\nThey are destined to fall, because they haven't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus feet. They haven't taken \nshelter of Lord Balarama. They haven't taken shelter of bhakti, which manifests through the mercy of \nthe spiritual and the predecessor spiritual masters.\nThe spiritual master must represent the predecessor spiritual masters. Only by representing the \npredecessor spiritual master can one strive to achieve the Lord by the right means.\nThe verse nayam atma bala hinena labhyo clearly states that one has to achieve the Lord by the right \nmeans. One should not be wild or careless. By the right means Krsna reveals Himself and one enters \nthe spiritual world.\n5\nThis is the meaning of akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda guru tattva means that Lord Balarama manifests \nHimself as guru in an unlimited variety of forms. And it is the service of guru to give one the strength \nto cross over the ocean of material existence to enter into the spiritual world.\nSo this is how we worship Lord Balarama on His appearance day. We should know that He is adi-guru. \nHe is the original guru and and all other gurus represent Him. Without His mercy, without taking \nshelter of Him, we will never be able to give up this sense gratification and attachment to the material \nworld.\nAs described in the song Gauranga Bolite Ha'be, Narottama das Thakur is praying.\nara kabe nitai-candera karuna karibe\nsamsara-vasana mora kabe tuccha habe\n\"When will Lord Nityananda have mercy upon me so that I can realize the uselessness of material \npleasure?'\nHe is praying in that way. Who is Nityananda? He is Lord Balarama. Nityananda is the same as Lord \nBalarama. He has appeared to serve Lord Caitanya in the same way as Lord Balarama has appeared to \nserve Lord Krsna.\nAnd as Prabhupada says in today's purport, \"Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and \nboth of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take shelter of Their lotus \nfeet.\"\nWhat is their weapon?\nkrsna-varnam tvisakrsnam\nsangopangastra-parsadam\nSB 11.5.32\nThe verse describes how Lord Caitanya appears with His weapons. What is Lord Caitanya's weapon? \nHe's not coming to chop off heads. Not coming with a club to beat and destroy. He's coming with the \nweapon of harinama sankirtan. That is the weapon He has come with in this age of Kali.\n\nSrila Bhaktisiddhanti Sarasvati Thakur describes in one article of the Harmonist Magazine.\n\"Nityananda alone possesses the distinctive function of the guru. In Nityananda the function is \nembodied. Nityananda is the servant-God. He serves Sri Gaurasundara by the distinctive method of \nreverential servitude. He is identical with Sri Balarama of krsna-lila.[...]\n[...]\"But Nityananda does not directly instruct in the confidential service of Krsna. Srimati Radhika is \nthe guru of the inner circle of the servants of Krsna. Srimati Radhika, however, accepts the offer of \nservice of only those souls who are specially favored by Nityananda and are deemed by Him to be fit \nfor Her service.\nSo in all respects we are dependent upon the mercy of Nityananda Balarama to become qualifided to \ndance in the spiritual world and to be fully engaged in loving devotional service to the Lord.\nThis is the goal. Prabhupada clearly states this right from the outset of the verse. The goal is to go back \nhome, back to Godhead. The goal is not to be happy in this material world.\nThe devotee who understands this goal may become happy in this world. But as Rupa Goswami says, \nthere is three types of happiness. 1) Happiness derived from sense gratification, which is temporary. 2) \nHappiness which comes from liberation, which can also be temporary.\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\nOne will fall down from his position of imagined superiority if he hasn't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus \nfeet. And 3) The happiness which comes from bhakti, by realizing\njivera 'svarupa' haya -- krsnera 'nitya-dasa'\nI am Krsna's eternal servant, and my only business in life is to find shelter at His lotus feet. This is real \nhappiness.\nBy the mercy of guru, by the mercy of predecessor gurus, and by the mercy of Lord Balarama. This is \nwhat it means to take shelter. And this is why we observe Lord Balarama's appearance day... to pray for\nthis strength.\nHare Krsna","attachment_name":"balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf","attachment_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/sites/default/files/attachments/balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf"},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"ru":{"title":"26 августа, 2018 - Алматы, Казахстан - Лекция на Баларама Пурниме - Английский/ Русский","event":"Festival","topic":"Шримад Бхагаватам","translation":"Русский","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"","attachment_name":""},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"counters":{"audio_page_view":0,"audio_play_count":0,"downloads":"147","video_page_view":0,"en_transcription_view":0,"ru_transcription_view":0,"en_summary_view":0,"ru_summary_view":0}},{"uuid":"eb9ba9ea-4a8e-4ab5-9a58-03009d5e764e","needs_translation":true,"created_date":"2018-08-11","published_date":"","author":"Niranjana Swami","part":"4","chapter":"30","verse":"10","download_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/download/33333","lecture_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/en/lecture/26394","duration":"01:56:48","downloads":"129","audio_link":"https://nrs-site.s3.amazonaws.com/lectures/2018/2018-08/2018.08.11_e.s.nirandzhana_svami._shb-4.30.10_retrit.magdalinovka-lower_compression.mp3","soundCloud_link":"https://soundcloud.com/niranjana-swami/august-11-2013-disciple","youtube":"","en":{"title":"August 11, 2018 - Disciple Retreat - Magdalinivka - SB 4.30.10 - English/ Russian","event":"Retreat","topic":"Srimad Bhagavatam","translation":"Russian","location":"Magdalinivka","transcription":{"text":"\n\nAugust 11, 2018 – Disciple Retreat in Magdalinivka – SB 4.30.10 \n \nThe following is a partially-edited transcription of a lecture given on August 11, 2018, at the \nDisciple Retreat in Magdalinivka, Ukraine: \n \n \nye tu mam rudra-gitena \nsayam pratah samahitah \nstuvanty aham kama-varan \ndasye prajnam ca sobhanam \n \nTRANSLATION \nThose who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence. \n \nPURPORT \nGood intelligence means going back home, back to Godhead. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita \n(10.10): \n \ntesam satata-yuktanam \nbhajatam priti-purvakam \ndadami buddhi-yogam tam \nyena mam upayanti te \n \n\"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by \nwhich they can come to Me.\" \n \nOne who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know that the highest \nperfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this verse it is \nindicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracetas, the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is \nthe way of the parampara system. If we follow the acaryas, we attain the same benefit as our \npredecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly \nhearing Bhagavad-gita from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no difference \nbetween hearing Bhagavad-gita directly from the Supreme Lord and following a personality like \nArjuna, who formerly heard Bhagavad-gita directly from the Lord. Sometimes foolish people \nargue that since Krsna is not present at the moment, one cannot take direct instructions from \nHim. Such foolish people do not know that there is no difference between directly hearing \nBhagavad-gita and reading it, as long as one accepts Bhagavad-gita as it is, spoken by the Lord. \nHowever, if one wants to understand Bhagavad-gita by his imperfect interpretations, one \ncannot possibly understand the mysteries of Bhagavad-gita, even though one may be a great \n\nscholar according to mundane estimation. \n \nNiranjana Swami: \n \nI'd like to put this verse a little bit into context before we speak about the purport Srila \nPrabhupada gave on the verse.  \n \nThis verse is spoken about the Pracetas, the sons of King Pracinabarhisat. King Pracinabarhisat \nbecame known as a Prajapati entrusted with the responsibility to create progeny. He had ten \nsons. He instructed his sons to prepare for householder life which for them meant to perform \nausterities for 10,000 years.  \n \nWhile traveling west to execute their father's order, they come upon a big lake, so big that it \nlooked like an ocean. They became captivated by the beautiful appearance of this lake. All of a \nsudden, they heard the sounds of drums, kettledrums and other instruments being played. The \nsounds were coming from within the lake. Just then, appearing from within the lake appeared \nLord Siva. Lord Siva came to them because he understood them to be highly qualified persons.  \n \nAn interesting point which I noticed when I was looking at these verses this morning is that Lord \nSiva was also attracted to the Pracetas because they were dedicated to following the order of \ntheir father. Prabhupada said in the purport that because they were surrendered to following \nthat order, Lord Siva saw the Pracetas as highly qualified persons and therefore he wanted to \ngive His association to them.  \n \nI bring this point up because yesterday we were talking about Dhruva Maharaja who was fixed \non the order of his mother. His mother requested him to follow the recommendations of his \nstepmother Suruci... to go to the forest to seek out the Supreme Lord, again, for the fulfillment \nof his desire. That point is made today in this verse also. By offering this prayer given by Lord \nSiva, the Lord told the Pracetas, \"they can both fulfill their desires and attain good intelligence.\" \n \nDhruva Maharaja went to the forest to seek out the Supreme Lord because he also wanted the \nfulfillment of his desires. We didn't speak that much on that point yesterday, but we know what \nhis desires were.  \n \nDhruva Maharaja was insulted and wanted revenge. He wanted to get a kingdom better than \nhis father's, grandfather's and great-grandfather's. He was so fixed on his mother's instructions \nthat when Narada Muni, who saw Dhruva Maharaja as a good candidate just as Lord Siva saw \nthe Pracetas as good candidates, gave Dhruva Maharaja instructions to return home, Dhruva \nMaharaja was more intent on going to the forest to obtain the darshan of the Supreme Lord. He \nhad desires he wanted fulfilled from Him.  \n \nNarada Muni tested Dhruva by instructing him, \"Just become equipoised, be self-satisfied. Do \nnot be disturbed by these things you are feeling in your heart, The forest is no place for a young \nboy like you. You're too young for such austerities. Wait until you are older.\", Dhruva Maharaja \n\nwas nonetheless fixed. \"No I have to seek out the Supreme Lord. I was told by my mother that \nHe can take care of everything for me. Sorry I know those are good instructions, but they don't \ntouch my heart. I've got something else on my mind. \n \nDhruva was fixed. \"I was told by my mother that the Lord will take care of my desires. She told \nme to go to the forest and you're telling me, 'Don't go to the forest.'\"  \n \nNarada Muni, an expert judge of time, place, and circumstances, then adjusted everything. He \nstill saw Dhruva as a good candidate and gave him instructions how he could get his desires \nfulfilled.  \n \nInterestingly, because it's similar to what we are going to hear about the Pracetas, Narada Muni \nalso gave Dhruva Maharaja a mantra to chant. He told him, \"If you chant this mantra you will be \nblessed by the Lord according to your desire.\" Srila Prabhupada explained in one purport in that \nsection about Dhruva Maharaja, that Dhruva Maharaja was initiated in the Visnu-mantra and \nwas given the mantra \"om namo bhagavate vasudevaya.\" \n \nIn the pastime with the Pracetas, the Pracetas had an order from their father. They were strictly \nfollowing his order, Lord Siva appeared to them, saw them as highly qualified persons, and told \nthem that because they were so qualified, he wanted to give them a mantra, or stotra, to \nchant. He told them that by chanting this mantra, \"...you will certainly achieve all your desired \nobjectives without fail.\" SB 4.24.79 \n \nIn connection to this point, I wanted to read a few verses from a previous chapter,  \n \n\"Although rendering devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and worshiping \nHim are very difficult, if one vibrates or simply reads this stotra [prayer] composed and sung by \nme [Lord Siva], he will very easily be able to invoke the mercy of the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead.\" (SB 4.24.76) \n \n\"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the dearmost objective of all auspicious benedictions. \nA human being who sings this song sung by me can please the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead. Such a devotee, being fixed in the Lord's devotional service, can acquire whatever he \nwants from the Supreme Lord. (SB 4.24.77) \n \nIn other words, Lord Siva is telling them, \"You can get whatever you desire to accomplish. \nWorship the Lord and get the fulfillment of your desire.\"  \n \nAnd in today's verse, after gaining darshan of the Lord, the Lord told the Pracetas,  \n \n\"Those who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence.\" (SB 4.30.10 \n \n\nAnd what did Prabhupada say in the purport today? What is good intelligence? Anyone \nremember what Prabhupada said? Yes...to go back to Godhead. That is good intelligence. He \nquotes the verse,  \n \ntesam satata-yuktanam \nbhajatam priti-purvakam \ndadami buddhi-yogam tam \nyena mam upayanti te \n \n\"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by \nwhich they can come to Me.\" (BG 10.10) \n \nThis is good intelligence. One gets the fulfillment of his desires and goes back to Godhead.  \n \nDhruva Maharaja got the fulfillment of his desires. However, in this case, when the Lord \nappeared to Dhruva and revealed all the desires that He would fulfill for him, Dhruva Maharaja \nwas completely distressed.  \n \nSomeone might ask, \"Why was he distressed? He got the fulfillment of his desires.\" But \nVisvanath Cakravarti Thakur explains that Dhruva Maharaja was distressed because the Lord \nfulfilled his previous desires. And after getting the darshan of the Lord, he realized that those \nprevious desires were so paltry, so petty. \n \nWhat were his previous desires? He wanted revenge. He wanted a kingdom. When the Lord \nappeared before Dhruva Maharaja, He told Dhruva Maharaja, \"You will get your father's throne \nand you will rule your father's kingdom for 36,000 years.\" That's what Dhruva wanted. He was \npreviously thinking, \"I couldn't sit on my father's lap. I want to be able to sit on the throne.\" But \nhe wanted something even greater than that. We'll get to that.  \n \nBut the first thing the Lord said was that \"You will rule the kingdom for 36,000 years. You will \nperform sacrifices. But you will remember Me. There will be no obstacles in your service as \nKing. You will remember the goal of your sacrifices.\" \n \nThe Lord detailed how Dhruva will rule his father's kingdom. After that, he will have a kingdom \neven better than Lord Brahma's. He will have his own planet, the polestar within this universe. \nWhen all planets in this universe are destroyed at the time of universal devastation, the \npolestar will remain. So ultimately he would rule a kingdom even better than Lord Brahma's.  \n \nIn addition, the Lord also told Dhruva, \"Your stepbrother will go to the forest to hunt and he will \nbe killed. Your stepmother, when she hears that her son has been killed in the forest, out of \ngreat despair, she will enter into the forest to look for her son and she will be devoured by a \nforest fire.\"  \n \nThese points were spoken directly to Dhruva by the Lord. And then the Lord departed.  \n\n \nAlthough Dhruva got the fulfillment of his desires, he was lamenting. \"What is the value of \nthose desires in relation to what I just experienced in the darshan of the Lord?\"  \n \nAdditionally, when the Lord appeared to Dhruva, Dhruva became so overwhelmed, he offered \nprayers to glorify the Lord. In those prayers which he personally composed, he asked for only \none benediction from the Lord. \"Please let me always be in the association of Your devotees.\" \n \nHowever, the Lord departed without saying anything about his new request. Visvanath \nCakravarti Thakur explains that that was the reason why Dhruva Maharaja was thrown into \nlamentation even though he got the darshan of the Lord. Dhruva realized that, \"The Lord \nfulfilled all of my previous desires, but He didn't respond to what I said when I saw Him.\" \nDhruva was therefore condemning himself, saying, \"I have prayed only for useless things. My \nactivities were exactly like treatment given to a person who is already dead.\" (SB 4.9.34) \n \nAnyway, Dhruva Maharaja received the fulfilment of his desires. After ruling his father's \nkingdom for 36,000 years, when it was time for him to go to his next destination, a flower \nairplane descended from Vaikuntha. Death personified appeared before him. Death personified \nis a very fearful personality to behold. Most living beings do not know how to deal with this \npersonality. But what did Dhruva Maharaja do? He stepped on the head of death personified \nand used his head as a step to get into the flower airplane to go back to Godhead. \n \nIn this connection, Narada Muni gives the analogy how lightning and illumination appear \nsimultaneously. Death is also like that for those who are fully absorbed in thinking of Krsna. This \nis how important it is to be engaged fully in devotional service. In that state of consciousness, \none is prepared to meet death personified. The transition becomes easier for a devotee fully \nengaged in devotional service.  \n \nIn summary, Dhruva Maharaja got the fulfillment of his desires. Because he worshipped the \nLord and faithfully chanted the mantra given to him by Narada Muni, he ultimately went back \nto Godhead. \n \nLord Siva is telling the Pracetas the same thing, \"Chant this prayer I've given to you, be fixed in \ndevotional service, and one can acquire whatever he wants from the Lord.\" \n \nIn an earlier chapter, it is stated,  \n \n\"A devotee who rises early in the morning and with folded hands chants these prayers sung by \nLord Siva and gives facility to others to hear them certainly becomes free from all bondage to \nfruitive activities.\" (SB 4.24.78) \n \n\"My dear sons of the King, the prayers I have recited to you are meant for pleasing the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead, the Supersoul. I advise you to recite these prayers, which are as \neffective as great austerities.\" (SB 4.24.79) \n\n \nThe Pracetas, received and accepted these prayers. They then performed austerities for 10,000 \nyears while meditating on these prayers that were given to them by Lord Siva. \n \nAfter performing their austerities and chanting this prayer, the Lord appeared to the Pracetas. \nThe Lord, being very pleased by their austerities, spoke an often-quoted verse expressing His \npleasure with the Pracetas' austerities.  \n \n\"The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear sons of the King, I am very much pleased \nby the friendly relationships among you. All of you are engaged in one occupation -- devotional \nservice. I am so pleased with your mutual friendship that I wish you all good fortune. Now you \nmay ask a benediction of Me.\" (SB 4.30.8) \n \nThis is the verse where Srila Prabhupada speaks about unity in devotional service in his purport.  \n \n\"The Lord continued: Those who remember you every evening of every day will become \nfriendly with their brothers and with all other living entities. (SB 4.30.9) \n \nThe Pracetas also offered prayers to the Lord. This is proper... to begin with glorification. We \nshould not just ask for the fulfillment of our desires. Neither does a devotee think, \"If I glorify \nthe Lord I'll get a better chance of getting my desire fulfilled.\" A devotee glorifies the Lord \nbecause he has understood the true glories of the Lord, and therefore he glorifies the Lord's \nqualities, His beauty, His characteristics, His dealings with devotees, His opulences, etc..  \n \nIn addition, in their prayers, the Pracetas requested, ...\"we pray that You will be satisfied with \nus. That is our benediction. We do not desire anything other than Your full satisfaction.\" (SB \n4.30.30) \n \nAnd their other request was: \n \n\"Dear Lord, as long as we have to remain within this material world due to our material \ncontamination and wander from one type of body to another and from one planet to another, \nwe pray that we may associate with those who are engaged in discussing Your pastimes. We \npray for this benediction life after life, in different bodily forms and on different planets.\" (SB \n4.30.33) \n \nWhy do we read, again and again, that devotees who are in the presence of the Lord, pray, \"Let \nme have the association of Your devotees?\" There must be a certain special quality of devotees \nthat inspires devotees to ask the Lord, \"Let me be in the association of Your devotees.\" \n \nThe devotee thinks, \"If I could be in the association of devotees who are always glorifying You, \nthen I'm protected. I'll never be able to forget You.\" That is what a devotee wants. Under all \ncircumstances, he wants to be able to remember the Lord. A devotee thinks, \"If I'm in the \nassociation of devotees who are always glorifying You, how can I forget You?\" \n\n \nThere are so many verses which give emphasis to the value of devotee association. \nIn fact it was Narada Muni who said to King Pracinibarhisat, the father of the Pracetas:  \n \n\"My dear King, in the place where pure devotees live, following the rules and regulations and \nthus purely conscious and engaged with great eagerness in hearing and chanting the glories of \nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, in that place if one gets a chance to hear their constant \nflow of nectar, which is exactly like the waves of a river, one will forget the necessities of life -- \nnamely hunger and thirst -- and become immune to all kinds of fear, lamentation and illusion.\" \n(SB 4.29.39–40) \n \nNarada Muni was giving King Pracinabarhisat good instruction. When Narada Muni first visited \nthe king he was trying to get him to give up his attachment to fruitive activities. He told the \nallegorical story of King Puranjana in an attempt to convince him to give up his attachments. \nAfter hearing about Puranjana and then receiving further instruction from Narada Muni, the \nKing achieved liberation and then the story of King Pracinabarhisat was finished. Vidura then \nasked Maitreya, \"Can you go back to the Pracetas? What happened to them? What did they \nachieve?\" \n \nSo as we were explaining before, the Pracetas got the darshan of the Lord. The Lord asked them \nfor a benediction and their only requests were, \"We ask that you be satisfied by our devotional \nservice and that we have the association of devotees.\" \n \nLet us remember, however, that they were performing austerities under the request of their \nfather who told them to prepare for householder life. So they wanted to fulfill the desire of \ntheir father. So what did the Lord tell them? He said that, \"Because you are all united in \ndevotional service, you will all have your own kingdoms.\" \n \nImagine, each of them having their own kingdoms with no quarreling amongst themselves. The \nLord said, \"You will always have friendly relationships with your brothers and friendly \nrelationships towards all living entities.\" And then He told them, \"You will rule those kingdoms \nfor one million years.\" A million years! Of course, it's a million of our years. In celestial years, it \nwould be less. \n \nAs the Lord told Prahlada Maharaja, He similarly told the Pracetas, \"You will always be engaged \nin sacrifice. I'll be satisfied by your sacrifices so that you will not forget the actual goal.\" \n \nSometimes one may think that, \"Once one gets the darshan of the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead one soon goes back to Godhead.\" It's like the happy ending of the story. He gets the \ndarshan of the Lord and then goes back to Godhead. But here we see in the case of Dhruva \nMaharaja, he remained, reigning over his father's kingdom for 36,000 years. With the \nPracetas... they were ruling over their kingdoms for one million years. But they would perform \ntheir duties in this world without forgetting the Lord.  \n \n\nThat is what Prabhupada explained in his purports, that we perform our duties in this world, we \ntake the mantra which has been given to us, we chant that mantra, obtaining the association of \nthe Lord, and then after performing our duties in this world perfectly in Krsna consciousness, \nwe go back to Godhead.  \n \nIt's how we are supposed to live in this world. It's not that we are all just going to chant and \nwait for the Lord to appear to deliver us. No. We must understand how to perform our duties in \nthis world, especially those duties which have been entrusted to us and take the mantra which \nhas been given to us.  \n \nSrila Prabhupada compared the mantra given to the Pracetas by Lord Siva to receiving the Hare \nKrsna mantra. By performing our duties in Krsna consciousness while chanting the Hare Krsna \nmahamantra, at the appropriate time, all perfection will be there.  \n \nThe point that Srila Prabhupada makes in today's purport is that we should follow the decisions \nmade by those persons who received instructions from the Lord. Following their decisions is as \ngood as receiving instructions from the Lord.  \n \nPrabhupada says, \"One who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know \nthat the highest perfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this \nverse it is indicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracetas, the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is \nthe way of the parampara system. If we follow the acaryas, we attain the same benefit as our \npredecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly \nhearing Bhagavad-gita from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. (SB 4.30.10 Purport) \n \nOne follows the decisions of Arjuna. In other words, by having examples to follow we get \nstrength, courage, enthusiasm and determination to continue to execute our duties in this life.  \n \nWe oftentimes quote Sri Bhaktyaloka. We referred to that quote yesterday.  \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur explains: \n \n\"After receiving initiation and instructions from a bona fide guru, a fortunate disciple should \nfollow the path of the previous sadhus. Those who are proud neglect the previous mahajanas \nand create new paths. As a result, they soon proceed on their inauspicious path and ruin \nthemselves. It is said in the Skanda Purana: \n \nsa mrgyah sreyasam hetuh \npanthah santapa-varjitah \nanavapta-sramam purve \nyena santah pratasthire \n \n\n\"One should strictly follow the easy path which the previous mahajanas have accepted. That \npath bestows great auspiciousness and is devoid of all misery.\" (Sri Bhaktyaloka, Chapter 10) \n  \nWe speak on this point a lot. Actually this is the point I was asked to speak on today. I am just \ngetting to it now. But it's all connected. It's connected to Dhruva Maharaja, it's connected to \nthe Pracetas, it's connected to Haridas Thakur about whom Bhaktivinode Thakur speaks. He \nsays that we have to have examples, our mahajanas, from whom we take shelter. We must try \nto remember their activities and to remember their decisions in order to get strength. \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur continues,  \n \n\"By discussing the path of the previous sadhus, one gets determination, courage, and \nsatisfaction. \n \nWho does Bhaktivinode Thakur use as an example? He uses the example of Haridas Thakur. \nHaridas Thakur's path wasn't such an easy path to follow. But Bhaktivinode Thakur says that by \nremembering his path it becomes easy.  \n \nDoes that mean that we have to beaten through twenty-two marketplaces? Do we have to be \nthreatened to be killed? Persecuted? Haridas Thakur was subjected to so much. He was \ndragged to prison and threatened by the Kazi. He was told to give up his convictions and to stop \nchanting the holy names. Haridas Thakur's response was, \"You can cut my body to pieces but I \nwill never give up chanting the holy name of the Lord.\" \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur explains that Haridas Thakur taught by his example three very important \nprinciples to be followed by those who follow in the footsteps of previous sadhus. The first, is \nthat one must always be determined, in all circumstances, that \"Yes. I must be determined to \nexecute my duties in this world while remembering the Lord.  \n \nThe second is to never give up the chanting of Hare Krishna.  \n \nThe third principle is to be compassionate towards all other living beings. \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur says that this is the path given by our previous acaryas which must be \nfollowed. It's the easy path. What makes it the easy path to follow? Austerities for 10,000 years \nunder the water? This is the easy path to follow? To go to the forest to eat berries and dried   \nleaves, to then give up all eating, by living off breath alone? To perform severe austerities \nstanding on one toe? This is the easy path? To be threatened, to be beaten in twenty-two \nmarketplaces until death? This is the easy path I'm supposed to follow? \n \nBy remembering them or by following their decisions, whatever difficulties or obstacles we \nneed to overcome become easier for us to surrender. Without an example it's very difficult to \ndo something on our own. \n \n\nTherefore Bhaktivinode Thakur says that those who are proud create their own paths.  \n \n\"Those who are proud neglect the previous mahajanas and create new paths. As a result, they \nsoon proceed on their inauspicious path and ruin themselves.\" (Sri Bhaktyaloka, Chapter 10) \n \nIn other words, they have no one to follow for spiritual strength.  \n \nWe accept the path established by our mahajanas as our examples to follow. By remembering \nthem, whatever difficulties we have to undergo become easier. In comparison to them, our \nausterities are small. We make ourselves think that they are just so big, so difficult, impossible \nto overcome. \"How can I ever do it? This is too much.\" \n \nBut by remembering those who made good decisions and who showed by their example how \nthey crossed the ocean of material existence and went back home, back to Godhead, we get \nstrength, courage, determination and enthusiasm. It makes it easier. That's how it becomes the \neasy path. \n \nIn this regard, I've been telling devotees recently a very practical story I experienced. It means a \nlot to me. It moves my heart. It's what gave me strength. I'm sure that many have heard this \nstory, but I'll tell it again. I love telling it.  \n \nSarvajna dasa: About Sridhara Maharaja?  \n \nYes Sridhara Maharaja. It's such a perfect example. By remembering Sridhara Maharaja, I got \nstrength. We had a previous friendly relationship with each other before he came to Mayapura \nin 2004. When Sridhara Maharaja came to Mayapura, he understood he would soon be leaving \nthis world. He had two desires he wanted fulfilled before departing. He wanted to go to \nMayapura to take part in the installation of Panca Tattva and he wanted to be with his \ngodbrothers.  \n \nHe expressed those desires when he was told by Canadian doctors that he couldn't receive a \nliver transplant because the cancer had spread too far in his body. From Canada, he met \nIndradyumna Maharaja in London and then the two of them came together to Mayapura.  \n \nSridhara Maharaja liked my kirtans. One time when Sridhara Maharaja was staying in a \ndevotee's flat near Bhaktivedanta Hospital at the same time I was being treated in \nBhaktivedanta Hospital, Sridhara Maharaja called me and asked, \"Maharaja can you come over \nand chant with me?\" He was not terminally ill at that time. But he was having a lot of health \nproblems. He was staying in an apartment trying to recover from an earlier treatment.  \n \nSo as soon as I had an opportunity I went over and visited Maharaja. When I arrived I expressed \nhow happy I was to see him. The first thing he said to me was, \"You see that harmonium over \nthere? Can we chant?\" It was just myself and Sridhara Maharaja. The two of us just sat and had \nkirtan together. \n\n \nAnother time when he was in Bombay, Maharaja asked again if I could come. But I couldn't go \nthat time. I believe he was again staying someplace near the hospital in Bombay but I was in \nPune at the Pune Yatra. From Pune I had to immediately go someplace else. So I asked \nMaharaja to forgive me. I told him I couldn't come that time but next time I would definitely \nmake the time to visit and chant together with him. \n \nThe next time I saw Maharaja was in Mayapura. A large group of devotees assembled to receive \nhim. It was a wonderful reception. There's a little funny story in this connection. When \nMaharaja arrived he had all this red around his mouth. It looked like it was blood. When the \ndevotees saw him they were shocked, but nobody wanted to say anything. They came down \nand sat in the room with Sridhara Maharaja who then said, \"I was eating red candy.\"  \n \nAnyway, when I saw Sridhara Maharaja, I embraced him and I said, \"Sridhara Maharaja I'm just \nso happy to see you.\" One of Maharaja's desires was also to have was kirtan in his room every \nnight. So when I embraced Maharaja I just said, \"Maharaja if you want me, I'm available 24/7.\"    \n \nAs it turned out, Sridhara Maharaja did take part in the abhiseka. There are many pictures of \nhim bathing Lord Caitanya during the Panca Tattva abhiseka. He was so absorbed. After the \ndeities were installed Sridhara Maharaja was more or less restricted to his room. It was then \nwhen he had devotees come to his room every evening for kirtan.  \n \nMaharaja was oftentimes lying during these evening kirtans. He couldn't get up. His body was \nswollen, although he had a way of dismissing these things. Sridhara Maharaja was known as the \n\"Jolly Swami.\" He was happy to be in the association of devotees. Sometimes his stomach \nwould swell up with fluids and the doctors had to come in to remove the fluids from his \nstomach. His brothers and a couple of other devotees were there one time when the doctors \ncame in to do the procedure. Sridhara Maharaja turned to the doctor and said, \"It's a boy.\" \n \nAnyway, Maharaja's room was full of devotees, every night. Sridhara Maharaja, because he was \nlying in bed, would oftentimes dance with his arms because he couldn't get up to sit with the \ndevotees. He would say, \"Forgive me, I can't dance, but I'm dancing with you with my arms.\"  \n \nOne night, after the GBC meetings, I had a terrible headache. I was thinking, \"I don't know if I \ncan go to the kirtan tonight with this bad headache.\" I was of two minds. \"I told Sridhara \nMaharaja that I would be there every night, but maybe tonight is an exception.\" \n \nSo after the meeting, I wrote note to Mayapura dasa, Sridhara Maharaja's secretary. I wrote \nsomething like, \"Mayapura, could you please tell Sridhara Maharaja to forgive me. I'm not \ncoming this evening. I have a terrible headache. I'm going back to my room.\" At that time I was \nstaying in the Vaisnava Academy. I had to walk a bit of a distance from the meetings to the \nacademy. While I was walking to the academy, I started to think of Sridhara Maharaja. \"Wait a \nminute. Sridhara Maharaja is lying in bed with a terminal illness, having kirtan. He's in pain. \nWhat is my headache compared to what he is going through? I have a headache. But Sridhara \n\nMaharaja is dancing with his arms with the devotees in kirtan, and I have a little headache.\" \n \nWhile meditating on that, I started to think, \"Oh I better turn around. I better go back.\" What \nseemed to be very significant became insignificant by meditating on his example. I got strength \nfrom that example. So I went back, directly to Sridhara Maharaja's room. I opened up the door, \nstood in the doorway, and the room was full as it always was. I didn't want to go in because I \ndidn't want to step over any of the devotees. But Sridhara Maharaja looked up and saw me. He \nhad received the message from Mayapura. Maharaja looked at me and said, \"Come here.\" And I \nsaid, \"Maharaja, I don't want to disrupt all of the devotees.\" And Sridhara Maharaja said, \"No. \nCome here.\" And he told the devotees. \"Make room for Niranjana Swami.\" \n \nSo, I had to follow his instructions. He's my superior. I had no idea what was coming next. He \nsat up on the bed and said, \"Sit here.\" I was thinking, \"He is going to ask me to give a lecture?\" I \nhad no idea. So I sat down and I didn't know what's next. I don't remember if there was a kirtan \nat the time but I remember feeling like I was the center of attention. I was thinking, \"What's \nSridhara Maharaja going to do?\" \n \nSridhara Maharaja turns to his servant, Mayapura dasa, and says, \"Mayapura, give me the Tiger \nBalm.\" Do you know what Tiger Balm is? He took the Tiger Balm in his hands and said, \"Look at \nme.\" He took the Tiger Balm and started to massage my forehead with it. He just kept on \nmassaging my forehead. It went on for some time. The devotees resumed the kirtan and he was \njust massaging my forehead.  \n \nMaharaja was thinking of my headache. That's a Vaisnava. How can you not love such a \nVaisnava. Here he was thinking of my headache. Such compassion. Absorbed in the holy name. \nDetermined to be in the association of devotees. This is the path we follow. We don't just have \nto go to Bhagavatam to find examples. We can find so many examples in our lives of devotees \nwho are determined to serve under all circumstances. \n \nAnother example...I was just in Boston. There's a godbrother there of mine whose name is \nMukta Vandya dasa. He's a very simple-hearted devotee. He's always engaged in service. He's \nhad two heart attacks. He had one heart attack when he was living in Gita Nagari. He used to \nsell flowers every day in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which is about an hour away from Gita \nNagari. He was married at the time. He worked very hard selling flowers, but he would use \npractically all of the money he earned for the temple. In fact, he was sleeping in a small tool \nshed filled with tools.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu wasn't thinking about accummulating money for himself. He was just \nthinking about how to accummulate money for Radha Damodara and serve the temple. He \nwould work very hard. He'd work so hard that one day he had a heart attack on his way to \nwork. Krsna arranged that he had the heart attack while driving right close to the home of a \nperson who was his auto mechanic. When his mechanic saw him, he immediately knew what \nwas happening and called the hospital. He then had to be airlifted by a helicopter and was \ntaken to another hospital. They saved him. They put whatever they had to put in him. I believe \n\nit was a stent or something like that to open up the blockage.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu gradually recovered and continued to work. He was working a little bit \neasier though. After some time, he got rid of his home when his wife moved elsewhere. So he \nstayed in the basement of the temple building in a little corner. He kept all of his belongings \nthere. He continued to work every day selling flowers and continued to give his profits to the \ntemple.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu always wore very simple clothing. The van he drove for his flower \nbusiness was not very fancy. Unfortunately he had a second heart attack. By that time I was \nalready telling him. \"Mukta, you've got to slow down. You need to take care of your body. It's \nKrsna's body. It's not your body.\" He's loved by so many devotees. He's just a simple-hearted \ndevotee who always just wants to serve. \n \nNow Mukta Vandya Prabhu lives in the Boston temple. He's careful now not to push himself too \nhard. But he's still ready to do any service that needs to be done. He's just fully engaged in \nservice. If somebody comes to the temple, he preaches to them. He has no formal position. He \nhas a little room on the second floor of the temple. Whenever guests come to the temple, they \nalways go to see Mukta. He's the friend of everybody.  \n \nIf there's nobody to give class, Mukta Vandya will go downstairs to give Bhagavad-gita class. If \nthere's nobody to cook the offering, Mukta Vandya will be the first person to run down and \ncook for Radha Gopivallabha. \n \nThe day before I left Boston, one had to leave for Croatia because his father passed away. There \nwas nobody to buy all of the bhoga for a big feast for a big ceremony the temple was having the \nnext day. I arrived at the temple and came through back door of the temple. Mukta Vandya was \nstanding there by a van full of bhoga. He had gone to purchase all the bhoga for the feast with \nanother devotee who went with him to help to carry all of it. There was nobody to buy it, \nMukta Vandya just went out to do it. \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu always goes and buys flowers for the deities. Everybody who knows him \nat the flower market loves him. Sometimes he's given thousands of dollars worth of flowers for \nfree. He's the friend of everybody. Ajata satru. He just wants to serve. He's careful. He doesn't \npush his body. He knows his limits. \n \nOnce every month for a few days he goes to serve Satsvarupa das Goswami. He took first \ninitiation from Srila Prabhpuada but second initiation from Satsvarupa das Goswami. So he goes \nthere just so that he can have an opportunity to serve.  \n \nI was telling the story the other night about Vaisnava Prema. Who was going to see Vaisnava \nPrema practically every day? Who took care of all of the arrangements for him? It was Mukta \nVandya. It was Mukta Vandya who told me the story which I shared with all of you the other \nday. When I asked Mukta Vandya, \"Is Vaisnava Prema in pain?\" He told me, \"I can't say for sure. \n\nWhen I was there two days ago, he was crying although he appeared to be asleep. He didn't \nknow I was there. He was speaking aloud though and was saying, \"How beautiful Vrndavana is.\" \nSo I don't know if he was crying from the pain or if he was crying because he was seeing the \nbeauty of Vrndavana.  \n \nIt was Mukta Vandya who made all of the arrangements after Vaisnava Prema departed. He \nalso visits another devotees whose name is Dina Dayal. He is currently in a nursing home. He \ngoes and brings him prasadam to him all of the time. Mukta Vandya lives for service.  \n \nWhy should we not meditate on such examples? Those who lives for service. This is good \nintelligence. This is the way to go back to Godhead. The way to go back to Godhead is to be \nabsorbed in service. Those who are absorbed in service are making the best preparation for \ngoing back to Godhead. When we think of them, we get strength, courage, enthusiasm and \nsatisfaction. We should be looking for such examples in our life. And, as Srila Prabhupada says \nin today's purport, which should look at their good decisions. This is parampara. This is what it \nmeans to follow in the footsteps of those who are teaching by their example how to make the \nright decisions to be engaged in devotional service.  \n \nHowever long they may have to live in this world, they'll continue living in this world \nperforming their duties. And to get both the fulfillment of their desires and good intelligence.  \n \nPrabhupada says, \"Good intelligence means to go back home, back to Godhead.\" This is what \nwe can learn from those who serve as examples. We should relish hearing about these \nexamples. These examples bring devotional service to life. It makes it real. It gives us a purpose \nfor living in this world. And it gives us a goal to achieve at the end of this life. \n \nThis is what Srila Prabhupada has instructed in this verse about the Pracetas. \n \nI'll read the verse again and then we will end.  \n \nThose who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence.\" \n \nI'm sorry I went a little bit late, but I hope the message was clear. Hare Krsna. \n \n ","attachment_name":"transcription_sb_4.30.10_english.pdf","attachment_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/sites/default/files/attachments/transcription_sb_4.30.10_english.pdf"},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"ru":{"title":"11 августа, 2018 - Ретрит учеников - Магдалиновка - Ш.Б. 4.30.10 - Английский/ Русский","event":"Retreat","topic":"Шримад Бхагаватам","translation":"Русский","location":"Magdalinivka","transcription":{"text":"","attachment_name":""},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"counters":{"audio_page_view":0,"audio_play_count":0,"downloads":"129","video_page_view":0,"en_transcription_view":0,"ru_transcription_view":0,"en_summary_view":0,"ru_summary_view":0}},{"uuid":"1f8bcffa-5bd8-42c3-b89d-081bfb0e3fe4","needs_translation":true,"created_date":"2018-08-26","published_date":"","author":"Niranjana Swami","part":"7","chapter":"15","verse":"45","download_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/download/33355","lecture_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/en/lecture/26495","duration":"01:37:59","downloads":"147","audio_link":"https://nrs-site.s3.amazonaws.com/lectures/2018/2018-08/niranjana_swami_-_sb_7.15.45_on_balarama-purnima_-c2a0almaty_26-aug-2018.mp3","soundCloud_link":"https://soundcloud.com/niranjana-swami/august-26-2018-almaty","youtube":["https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsg2S32qsdM?rel=gallery-all&wmode=opaque&autoplay=0"],"en":{"title":"August 26, 2018 - Almaty, Kazakhstan - Balarama Purnima Class - English/ Russian","event":"Festival","topic":"Srimad Bhagavatam","translation":"Russian","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"\n\nTranscription of a Lecture Given on Balarama Purnima, August 26, 2018, in Almaty, Kazakhstan\nThe following is a partially-edited lecture given in Almaty, Kazakhstan on Balarama Purnima, August \n26, 2018\nToday we are observing the appearance of Lord Balarama. I will first speak about, \"Who is Lord \nBalarama?.\" I will then speak on a verse from Srimad Bhagavatam in which Srila Prabhupada speaks \nabout the necessity of getting spiritual strength from Lord Balarama.\nLord Balarama is the first expansion of Lord Krsna called a svamsa expansion. There's very little \ndifference between Krsna and Balarama. They are both the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nSome of the differences are that is Krsna is blackish like the monsoon raincloud and Balarama is white.\nKrsna plays a flute and Balarama plays a buffalo horn. Sometimes Balarama carries a flute but most \noften He carries a buffalo horn in Vrndavana. Balarama sometimes carries a plow and club.\nBalarama manifested in Vrndavana as Krsna's elder brother. He first appeared in the womb of Devaki \nand later, by the arrangement of Yogamaya, He was transferred to the womb on Rohini. In Vrndavana, \nBalarama is known as Rohininandana, the son of Rohini.\nOutside of Vrndavana, Lord Balarama is manifest as Mula-sankarsana. Mula-sankarsana is the first \nexpansion coming from Lord Balarama. When Lord Balarama appeared in Vrndavana in the womb of \nRohini, this Mula-sankarsana became drawn to Him and appeared within Him. This is explained in \nGopal Campu. Just as Krsna never leaves Vrndavana, Balarama never leaves Vrndavana.\nFrom Lord Balarama manifests His plenary expansions beginning with Mula-sankarsana. As Mula-\nsankarsana, Balarama is manifest outside of Vrndavana in Mathura and Dwaraka.\nFrom Balarama also comes all living entities. Even the nitya-siddhas in the spiritual world, all of \nKrsna's devotees who are either in santa rasa, dasya rasa, sakyha rasa or vatsalya rasa are all coming \nfrom Lord Balarama. Vrndavana is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama. In fact, the whole \ndhama is a manifestation coming from Lord Balarama.\nSo Balarama serves Krsna by providing all this for Krsna's pleasure in the spiritual world. Those in \nconjugal rasa, the gopis, are expansions coming from Srimati Radharani.\nIn this way, all of Krsna's eternal associates, Krsna parisada, are manifestations coming from either \nLord Balarama or Srimati Radharani in the spiritual world.\nMula-sankarsana further expands as Maha-sankarsana. As Maha-sankarsana He becomes the source of \nall of the living entities who are serving Krsna in Vaikuntha.\nWhen we say, \"From Lord Balarama comes\", it suggests that at one time, within time, the living entities\nmanifested from Lord Balarama. But we should know that being under the influence of material time, \nthese things are difficult to conceive in the material world.\n\nFor instance, Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita to Arjuna, \"Never was there a time when you did not exist, \nnever was there a time when all these kings assembled in the battlefield did not exist, never was there a \ntime when I did not exist, nor in the future will any of us cease to be.\" (BG 2.12)\nSo when we say that the living entities are all emanations or expansions coming from Lord Balarama, \nimmediately we have a tendency to think, \"Oh at some point in time, they manifested.\" However, they \nare all eternally manifest.\nJust as Krsna, as stated in Brahma Samhita, is beginningless. Lord Brahma says that Krsna is advaitam \nacyutam, anadim, ananta-rupam. He is nondual. His body is never subject to decay. He is the \nbeginning. He has no end. He is the source of everything. So beginningless means, never was there a \ntime when He did not exist.\nIn the same way, never was there a time when Lord Balarama did not exist. Never was there a time \nwhen all of Krsna's eternal associates did not exist, and the living entities, the jivas, never was there a \ntime when they did not exist. Krsna's energies are always existing simultaneously along with Krsna.\nJust like this material world goes through cycles. It's manifest, it stays for some time and then \nunmanifest. But this manifestation and unmanifestation is an eternal process without beginning or end.\nIf I give you a little time to think about it— just a little time. Never was there a time when Krsna, \nBalarama, the living entities did not exist. This cannot be understood by the limited mind. As long as \nwe are under the influence of time, it is very difficult to understand that which is existing in eternal \ntime.\nKrsna says \"the spiritual world is unmanifest, infallible, and it is the supreme destination. When one \ngoes there he never has to come back. \"When Krsna says that the spiritual world is unmanifest, does it \nmean that it doesn't exist? No. Never was there a time when it manifested. It's eternal. And Krsna says \nthat when one goes there, he never comes back. Tad dhama paramam mama. \"That is My supreme \nabode.\" (BG 8.21)\nSo, as we said, Balarama is the first expansion coming from Krsna. But when did Balarama expand \nfrom Krsna? And when did Maha-sankarsana, Mula-sankarsana expand from the original Balarama? \nAnd when from the Mula-sankarsana did Maha-sankarsana manifest in order to manifest the Vaikuntha \nplanets and all of Krsna's servants in the Vaikuntha planets who serve Him in His various forms? We \ncannot say when it happened. We only use those terms because we think in those terms. And we won't \nbe able to fully understand until we go beyond the influence of time ourselves. Those who are beyond \nthe influence of time, for them, time is ever-present. Krsna's pastimes and Balarama's pastimes in the \nspiritual world are eternally manifest.\nTime is also manifest in the spiritual world. But there it exists to assist Krsna and Balarama in Their \npastimes. There is no destructive feature of time in the spiritual world.\nEvery morning, Krsna, Balarama, and Their cowherd boyfriends after breakfast and milking the cows, \ngo out to the pastures. During the day when the sun is fully manifest in the sky, They along with the \ncowherd boys take shelter in the caves of Govardhana. As the sun continues to pass, later in the evening\nKrsna and Balarama with Their cowherd boyfriends and the cows, return to Gokula.\n\n2\nIn the spiritual world, time is manifest just to assist Krsna in His pastimes. But there is no destructive \nfeature of time as time destroys everything in the material world.\nKrsna tells Arjuna when He manifested the universal form, \"kalo 'smi loka-ksaya-krt pravrddho\", Time \nI am, the great destroyer of the worlds.\" (BG 11.32)\nSo when Krsna creates this material world, first He creates time. That's how creation takes place. \nOtherwise how could creation take place if there was no time? So when it's time for unmanifested \nmaterial elements to manifest as the external energy, time first appears.\nThen from Maha-sankarsana, as we said, in the spiritual world comes Karanadakasayi Visnu, who is \nalso a manifestation of Lord Balarama. And from Karandakasayi Visnu comes Garbodakasayi Visnu \nwho enters into each universe, which are generated from Karanadakasayi Visnu. And from \nGarbodakasayi Visnu who lies in the Garbodaka Ocean, comes the first created being in the universe, \nLord Brahma.\nThey are all expansions coming from Lord Balarama. Then there is Ksirodakasayi Visnu, who is also \nthe supersoul, manifested in the heart of all living beings. After the manifestation of Ksirodakasayi \nVisnu, comes Sesa who is a manifestation of the Lord who serves the Lord in various ways in this \nworld.\nAnanta-sesa, on each of His hoods, holds material universes. That's spiritual strength. Imagine holding \nunlimited universes on your hoods, and you standing on nothing? Try to conceive. It's inconceivable.\nSo Ananta-sea is holding all the universes on his different hoods but he rests on nothing. He is self-\nsufficient. And He is a manifestation of Lord Balarama.\nThere are two manifestations of Sesa. There's Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods, and \nthen there is the Ananta-sesa who is the bed of Lord Visnu. In the Laghu-bhagavatamrita Rupa \nGoswami explains that the Ananta-sesa who holds the universe on His hoods is an avesa avatara of \nLord Balarama. He is saktyavesa. He's an empowered jiva who holds the universe on his heads as \nAnanta-sesa.\nThe other manifestation of Sesa is a plenary expansion of Lord Balarama upon whom Lord Visnu lies.\nAnanta-sesa serves Lord Krsna, just as Lord Balarama is serving Lord Krsna in all of these different \nforms in the matter of creation and maintenance of this cosmic manifestation. Ananta-sesa is also \nmanifest as Krsna's pillow, Krsna's shoes, Krsna's bed, Krsna's sacred thread, Krsna's garments, etc.. In \nthis way, Ananta-sesa is rendering service to Krsna.\nSo Lord Balarama, in His different manifestations, is rendering service to Krsna in unlimited ways. \nEven though Lord Balarama is Krsna Himself, He is always absorbed in the mood of, \"I am Krsna's \nservant.\"\nLord Balarama's service mood towards Krsna is described as sankula, or mixed. He is Krsna's friend. \nKrsna goes out with his cowherd boyfriends. Lord Balarama is going with Him into the pasturing \n\ngrounds. He's Krsna's servant as we already described in various ways how Lord Balarama renders \nservice to Krsna. And He also has a mood of vatsalya, because He is Krsna's older brother.\nIn Vedic culture, ancient culture, the older brother is always worshipped and respected as one's \nsuperior. So Balarama also has this vatsalya mood of protecting Krsna.\nWhen Balarama and Krsna entered into the forest of Dhenukasura, Krsna spoke about Lord Balarama \nas follows:\n\"O greatest of Lords, just see how these trees are bowing their heads at Your lotus feet, which are \nworshipable by the immortal demigods. The trees are offering You their fruits and flowers to eradicate \nthe dark ignorance that has caused their birth as trees.\" (SB 10.15.5)\nSo Krsna is considering Balarama His superior. In the forest of Dhenukasura, Balarama is lying down \nwith His head on the lap of the cowherd boys and Krsna is taking Balarama's lotus feet and is \nmassaging them. So Balarama also serves Krsna in this vatsalya mood and is treated as a superior by \nKrsna. Balarama also serves Krsna in madhurya-rasa. But to do that, He is manifested as Ananga-\nmanjari, the sister of Radharani.\nBalarama is also considered Adi-guru. Adi-guru means the original guru. Just as Krsna treats Balarama \nas a superior, He also treats Him as guru. Balarama is akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda means unlimited. \nIn other words, Balarama is the guru that manifests in unlimited forms to serve as guru. And all gurus \nare understood to be representatives of Lord Balarama, who is the source of spiritual strength.\nPrabhupada explains in Krsna book. \"In the Upanisad it is stated, nayam atma bala-hinena labhyah. The\npurport is that one cannot attain the supreme platform of self-realization without being sufficiently \nfavored by Balarama. Bala does not mean physical strength. No one can attain spiritual perfection by \nphysical strength. One must have the spiritual strength which is infused by Balarama, or Sankarsana. \nAnanta, or Sesa, is the power which sustains all the planets in their different positions. Materially this \nsustaining power is known as the law of gravitation, but actually it is a display of the potency of \nSankarsana. Balarama, or Sankarsana, is spiritual power, or the original spiritual master. Therefore \nLord Nityananda Prabhu, who is also the incarnation of Balarama, is the original spiritual master. And \nthe spiritual master is the representative of Balarama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who \nsupplies spiritual strength. In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is confirmed that the spiritual master is the \nmanifestation of the mercy of Krsna.\" (Krsna Book Ch. 2)\nSo Prabhupada refers to the verse from the Mundaka Upanisad.\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvan\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nThis verse means, \"The Supreme Lord cannot be attained by one who has no spiritual strength, one \nwho is careless or wild, or whose austerites are inappropriate. The Lord appears before a person who \nstrives by the right means to attain Him. Such a person enters the spiritual world.\"\n\nOne requires spiritual strength in order to understand Krsna and to enter the spiritual world. \nPrabhupada says that we are not talking about physical strength. Spiritual strength is the strength to \novercome the influence of the modes of material nature, to cross the ocean of material existence, and to\nbecome qualified to enter into that supreme abode which is unmanifest and infallible.\nWho is the source of spiritual strength? It is Balarama who is akhanda guru tattva. He manifests \nHimself in various forms in order to give strength to the living entities in the material world so they can\nfind the determination, courage, and satisfaction to overcome the stringent laws of material nature and \nto achieve entrance into that eternal abode.\nAs the Mundaka Upanisad says, \"Krsna manifests Himself to that person who strives to achieve Him \nby the right means.\" What is the right means?\nThat is the verse we wanted to read today from Srimad Bhagavatam. This verse speaks about the right \nmeans to cross the ocean of material existence, by getting strength from the spiritual master and \npredecessor spiritual masters.\nHow can we overcome the illusory energy by our own strength? A devotee never thinks, \"I am \nspiritually strong by my own endeavors.\" He knows that whatever spiritual strength he has, has been \ngiven to him because he is taking shelter of spiritual strength.\nJust as one takes shelter of Krsna consciousness,\nkrsna -- surya-sama, maya haya andhakara\nyahan krsna, tahan nahi mayara adhikara\n\"Krsna is compared to sunshine, and maya is compared to darkness. Wherever there is sunshine, there \ncannot be darkness. As soon as one takes to Krsna consciousness, the darkness of illusion (the influence\nof the external energy) will immediately vanish. (Madhya 22.31)\nWherever there is Krsna, there cannot be maya. Wherever there is Krsna consciousness, there cannot be\nthe influence of illusion. But we cannot manifest Krsna before us by our own strength.\nSrimad Bhagavatam states:\nathapi te deva padambuja-dvaya-\nprasada-lesanugrhita eva hi\njanati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno\nna canya eko 'pi ciram vicinvan\nMy Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the \ngreatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years. (SB \n10.14.29)\nUnless one gets that drop of mercy he cannot understand.\n3\nKrsna tells Arjuna,\n\nMy dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before \nyou, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My \nunderstanding. (Bg 11.54)\nTherefore the knowledge and strength to cross over the material existence is coming from Krsna and \nBalarama. Balarama is Adi-guru, the original guru, He is the original source of all spiritual strength. If \none wishes to get spiritual strength, he must take shelter of guru and as this verse we are going to read \ntoday says, our predecessor gurus.\nSo this is the verse and purport that I am going to read in this connection. It's the 7th Canto of Srimad \nBhagavatam, 15th chapter, 45th verse.\nyavan nr-kaya-ratham atma-vasopakalpam\ndhatte garistha-caranarcanaya nisatam\njnanasim acyuta-balo dadhad asta-satruh\nsvananda-tusta upasanta idam vijahyat\nTRANSLATION\nAs long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and paraphernalia, which are \nnot fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, namely his spiritual \nmaster and the spiritual master's predecessors. By their mercy, one can sharpen the sword of \nknowledge, and with the power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's mercy one must then \nconquer the enemies mentioned above. In this way, the devotee should be able to merge into his \nown transcendental bliss, and then he may give up his body and resume his spiritual identity.\nThis verse refers to the enemies mentioned in the previous verse. So in order to more fully understand \nwhat this verse is talking about one should know what these enemies are. And this is the previous verse.\nIn the conditioned stage, one's conceptions of life are sometimes polluted by passion and \nignorance, which are exhibited by attachment, hostility, greed, lamentation, illusion, fear, \nmadness, false prestige, insults, fault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, \nbewilderment, hunger and sleep. All of these are enemies. Sometimes one's conceptions are also \npolluted by goodness. (SB 7.15.43–44)\nIs there anyone who thinks that these enemies that we've listed have all been conquered? I'll read them \none more time.\nAttachment. One by one. Hostility. Greed. Lamentation, illusion, fear, madness, false prestige, insult, \nfault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, bewilderment, hunger, sleep. All of these are \nenemies.\nBy the strength of our own intelligence, to some degree, we may be able to deal with some of these \nenemies. But Prabhupada is going to make the point very clear in the purport that simply by knowledge\nitself one cannot cut away from these enemies.\nKrsna says clearly that the living entities in the material world are struggling very hard with material \nexistence. None of us can say, \"I'm not struggling with these things.\".\n\nOftentimes devotees ask me how to deal with the fact that they are struggling with Krsna \nconsciousness. I say to them, \"You're struggling?! It's good that you're struggling. As soon as you stop \nstruggling you're finished.\" If we're struggling it means that we want to overcome these bad influences. \nThose who don't want to overcome them, think it's natural to be lusty. It's natural to be envious. They \ndon't think they are in illusion because they think illusion is reality.\nWe should therefore struggle to find the spiritual strength to overcome these enemies. That much \nstruggling we have to do. If we don't struggle for that, we'll have to struggle with material nature, \nwhich is very hard on the living entity, and causes so much anxiety.\nPrabhupada says that this material world is kuntha. It is a place of anxiety. It cannot be avoided. \nEverything in this world is temporary and the eternal living entity is going to have to be in anxiety \nabout losing that which he is attached to. So he struggles with this illusory energy.\nA devotee therefore prays. \"Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare/ Hare Rama Hare Rama \nRama Rama Hare Hare.\" He's praying to Krsna. He's praying to Lord Balarama. \"Please give me the \nstrength so that I may be engaged in Krsna's service.\" He's praying to Srimati Radharani. Please engage\nme in Krsna's service. He's looking for strength. This is his struggle.\nSo just as this verse states that \"As long as one has to accept a material body, with its different parts and\nparaphernalia, which are not fully under one's control, one must have the lotus feet of his superiors, \nnamely his spiritual master and the spiritual master's predecessors.\"\nSo let me read the purport. Please take note of the emphasis Srila Prabhupada is making about strength.\nIt's a little bit long. Try to listen carefully.\nIn Bhagavad-gita (4.9) the Lord says:\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\" This is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\nIn other words, this is what it means to accept help from the superiors is to go back home, back to \nGodhead. This is the destination that Krsna wants all living entities to achieve. And Lord Balarama and\nthose in the line of Lord Balarama are meant to give us the strength to go back to the spiritual world.\nThis is the highest perfection of life, and the human body is meant for this purpose.\n... to go back home, back to Godhead.\nIt is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.20.17):\nnr-deham adyam sulabham sudurlabham\nplavam sukalpam guru-karnadharam\n\nmayanukulena nabhasvateritam\npuman bhavabdhim na taret sa atma-ha\nThis human form of body is a most valuable boat, and the spiritual master is the captain, guru-\nkarnadharam, to guide the boat in plying across the ocean of nescience. The instruction of Krsna \nis a favorable breeze. One must use all these facilities to cross over the ocean of nescience. Since \nthe spiritual master is the captain, one must serve the spiritual master very sincerely so that by his\nmercy one will be able to get the mercy of the Supreme Lord.\nA significant word here is acyuta-balah. The spiritual master is certainly very merciful to his \ndisciples, and consequently by satisfying him a devotee gets strength from the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore says, guru-krsna-prasade paya \nbhakti-lata-bija: [Cc. Madhya 19.151] one must first please the spiritual master, and then one \nautomatically pleases Krsna and gets the strength with which to cross the ocean of nescience.\nThis is the point I was making before. Simply knowledge, is insufficient. One can study the Vedas for \nmillions of births, as Lord Brahma says in Brahma Samhita, and still never be able to understand \nKrsna. So it's not simply by knowledge that one can cross the ocean of material existence.\nThe purport continues:\nIf one seriously desires to return home, back to Godhead, one must therefore become strong \nenough by pleasing the spiritual master, for thus one gets the weapon with which to conquer the \nenemy, and one also gets the grace of Krsna. Simply getting the weapon of jnana is insufficient. \nOne must sharpen the weapon by serving the spiritual master and adhering to his instructions. \nThen the candidate will get the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nPrabhupada then gives a nice analogy.\nIn general warfare one must take help from his chariot and horses in order to conquer his enemy, \nand after conquering his enemies he may give up the chariot and its paraphernalia. Similarly, as \nlong as one has a human body, one should fully use it to obtain the highest perfection of life, \nnamely going back home, back to Godhead.\nUsing the human form of life to its full potential.\nkamasya nendriya-pritir\nlabho jiveta yavata\njivasya tattva-jijnasa\nnartho yas ceha karmabhih\nLife's desires should never be directed toward sense gratification. One should desire only a healthy life,\nor self-preservation, since a human being is meant for inquiry about the Absolute Truth. Nothing else \nshould be the goal of one's works. (SB 1.2.10)\nThe perfection of knowledge is certainly to become transcendentally situated (brahma-bhuta [SB \n4.30.20]). As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):\n\nbrahma-bhutah prasannatma\nna socati na kanksati\nsamah sarvesu bhutesu\nmad-bhaktim labhate param\n\"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully \njoyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living \nentities. In that state he attains pure devotional service.\" Simply by cultivating knowledge as the \nimpersonalists do, one cannot get out of the clutches of maya. One must attain the platform of \nbhakti.\nbhaktya mam abhijanati\nyavan yas casmi tattvatah\ntato mam tattvato jnatva\nvisate tad-anantaram\n\"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one \nis in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of \nGod.\" (Bg. 18.55) Unless one has attained the stage of devotional service and the mercy of the \nspiritual master and Krsna, there is a possibility that one may fall down and again accept a \nmaterial body. Therefore Krsna stresses in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):\njanma karma ca me divyam\nevam yo vetti tattvatah\ntyaktva deham punar janma\nnaiti mam eti so 'rjuna\n\"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon \nleaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O \nArjuna.\"\nThe word tattvatah, meaning \"in reality,\" is very important. Tato mam tattvato jnatva. Unless one \nunderstands Krsna in truth by the mercy of the spiritual master, one is not free to give up his \nmaterial body.\nIn other words, one has to accept another material body.\n4\nAs it is said, aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah: [SB \n10.2.32] if one neglects to serve the lotus feet of Krsna, one cannot become free from the material\nclutches simply by knowledge. Even if one attains the stage of brahma-padam, merging in \nBrahman, without bhakti he is prone to fall down. One must be very careful in regard to the \ndanger of falling down again into material bondage. The only insurance is to come to the stage of \nbhakti, from which one is sure not to fall. Then one is free from the activities of the material \nworld. In summary, as stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, one must get in touch with a bona fide\nspiritual master coming in the parampara of Krsna consciousness, for by his mercy and \n\ninstructions one is able to get strength from Krsna. Thus one engages in devotional service and \nattains the ultimate goal of life, the lotus feet of Visnu.\nSignificant in this verse are the words jnanasim acyuta-balah. Jnanasim, the sword of knowledge, \nis given by Krsna, and when one serves the guru and Krsna in order to hold the sword of Krsna's \ninstructions, Balarama gives one strength. Balarama is Nityananda. Vrajendra-nandana yei, saci-\nsuta haila sei, balarama ha-ila nitai. This bala -- Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya \nMahaprabhu, and both of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take \nshelter of Their lotus feet. They come especially to deliver the fallen souls of this age, papi tapi \nyata chila, hari-name uddharila. Their weapon is sankirtana, hari-nama. Thus one should accept \nthe sword of knowledge from Krsna and be strong with the mercy of Balarama. We are therefore \nworshiping Krsna-Balarama in Vrndavana. In the Mundaka Upanisad (3.2.4) it is said:\nnayam atma bala-hinena labhyo\nna ca pramadat tapaso vapy alingat\netair upayair yatate yas tu vidvams\ntasyaisa atma visate brahma-dhama\nOne cannot attain the goal of life without the mercy of Balarama. Sri Narottama dasa Thakura \ntherefore says, nitaiyera karuna habe, vraje radha-krsna pabe: when one receives the mercy of \nBalarama, Nityananda, one can attain the lotus feet of Radha and Krsna very easily.\nse sambandha nahi yara,   \nbrtha janma gela tara,\nvidya-kule hi karibe tara\nIf one has no connection with Nitai, Balarama, then even though one is a very learned scholar or \njnani or has taken birth in a very respectable family, these assets will not help him. We must \ntherefore conquer the enemies of Krsna consciousness with the strength received from Balarama. \n[end of purport]\nThese enemies are like whips. They are beating us again and again, keeping us in the bodily \nidentification. Imagine living with enemies. We are living with enemies right in our own bodies.\nKrsna described the enemy as lust. When Arjuna asked Krsna, \"What is it Krsna that compels a person \nto act even against his own will?\" Krsna replied that \"It's lust only Arjuna which is later transformed in \nanger, which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world.\" How to conquer this enemy on our own \nstrength?\nThose who try to do it on the strength of their own intelligence,\ntvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\n (SB 10.2.32)\n\n[...]their intelligence is impure. They fall down from their position of imagined superiority because \nthey have no regard for Your lotus feet.\nThey are destined to fall, because they haven't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus feet. They haven't taken \nshelter of Lord Balarama. They haven't taken shelter of bhakti, which manifests through the mercy of \nthe spiritual and the predecessor spiritual masters.\nThe spiritual master must represent the predecessor spiritual masters. Only by representing the \npredecessor spiritual master can one strive to achieve the Lord by the right means.\nThe verse nayam atma bala hinena labhyo clearly states that one has to achieve the Lord by the right \nmeans. One should not be wild or careless. By the right means Krsna reveals Himself and one enters \nthe spiritual world.\n5\nThis is the meaning of akhanda guru tattva. Akhanda guru tattva means that Lord Balarama manifests \nHimself as guru in an unlimited variety of forms. And it is the service of guru to give one the strength \nto cross over the ocean of material existence to enter into the spiritual world.\nSo this is how we worship Lord Balarama on His appearance day. We should know that He is adi-guru. \nHe is the original guru and and all other gurus represent Him. Without His mercy, without taking \nshelter of Him, we will never be able to give up this sense gratification and attachment to the material \nworld.\nAs described in the song Gauranga Bolite Ha'be, Narottama das Thakur is praying.\nara kabe nitai-candera karuna karibe\nsamsara-vasana mora kabe tuccha habe\n\"When will Lord Nityananda have mercy upon me so that I can realize the uselessness of material \npleasure?'\nHe is praying in that way. Who is Nityananda? He is Lord Balarama. Nityananda is the same as Lord \nBalarama. He has appeared to serve Lord Caitanya in the same way as Lord Balarama has appeared to \nserve Lord Krsna.\nAnd as Prabhupada says in today's purport, \"Balarama -- comes with Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and \nboth of Them are so merciful that in this Age of Kali one may very easily take shelter of Their lotus \nfeet.\"\nWhat is their weapon?\nkrsna-varnam tvisakrsnam\nsangopangastra-parsadam\nSB 11.5.32\nThe verse describes how Lord Caitanya appears with His weapons. What is Lord Caitanya's weapon? \nHe's not coming to chop off heads. Not coming with a club to beat and destroy. He's coming with the \nweapon of harinama sankirtan. That is the weapon He has come with in this age of Kali.\n\nSrila Bhaktisiddhanti Sarasvati Thakur describes in one article of the Harmonist Magazine.\n\"Nityananda alone possesses the distinctive function of the guru. In Nityananda the function is \nembodied. Nityananda is the servant-God. He serves Sri Gaurasundara by the distinctive method of \nreverential servitude. He is identical with Sri Balarama of krsna-lila.[...]\n[...]\"But Nityananda does not directly instruct in the confidential service of Krsna. Srimati Radhika is \nthe guru of the inner circle of the servants of Krsna. Srimati Radhika, however, accepts the offer of \nservice of only those souls who are specially favored by Nityananda and are deemed by Him to be fit \nfor Her service.\nSo in all respects we are dependent upon the mercy of Nityananda Balarama to become qualifided to \ndance in the spiritual world and to be fully engaged in loving devotional service to the Lord.\nThis is the goal. Prabhupada clearly states this right from the outset of the verse. The goal is to go back \nhome, back to Godhead. The goal is not to be happy in this material world.\nThe devotee who understands this goal may become happy in this world. But as Rupa Goswami says, \nthere is three types of happiness. 1) Happiness derived from sense gratification, which is temporary. 2) \nHappiness which comes from liberation, which can also be temporary.\naruhya krcchrena param padam tatah\npatanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah\nOne will fall down from his position of imagined superiority if he hasn't taken shelter of Krsna's lotus \nfeet. And 3) The happiness which comes from bhakti, by realizing\njivera 'svarupa' haya -- krsnera 'nitya-dasa'\nI am Krsna's eternal servant, and my only business in life is to find shelter at His lotus feet. This is real \nhappiness.\nBy the mercy of guru, by the mercy of predecessor gurus, and by the mercy of Lord Balarama. This is \nwhat it means to take shelter. And this is why we observe Lord Balarama's appearance day... to pray for\nthis strength.\nHare Krsna","attachment_name":"balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf","attachment_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/sites/default/files/attachments/balarama_purnima_august_26_2018_in_almaty_kazakhstan.pdf"},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"ru":{"title":"26 августа, 2018 - Алматы, Казахстан - Лекция на Баларама Пурниме - Английский/ Русский","event":"Festival","topic":"Шримад Бхагаватам","translation":"Русский","location":"Almaty","transcription":{"text":"","attachment_name":""},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"counters":{"audio_page_view":0,"audio_play_count":0,"downloads":"147","video_page_view":0,"en_transcription_view":0,"ru_transcription_view":0,"en_summary_view":0,"ru_summary_view":0}},{"uuid":"eb9ba9ea-4a8e-4ab5-9a58-03009d5e764e","needs_translation":true,"created_date":"2018-08-11","published_date":"","author":"Niranjana Swami","part":"4","chapter":"30","verse":"10","download_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/download/33333","lecture_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/en/lecture/26394","duration":"01:56:48","downloads":"129","audio_link":"https://nrs-site.s3.amazonaws.com/lectures/2018/2018-08/2018.08.11_e.s.nirandzhana_svami._shb-4.30.10_retrit.magdalinovka-lower_compression.mp3","soundCloud_link":"https://soundcloud.com/niranjana-swami/august-11-2013-disciple","youtube":"","en":{"title":"August 11, 2018 - Disciple Retreat - Magdalinivka - SB 4.30.10 - English/ Russian","event":"Retreat","topic":"Srimad Bhagavatam","translation":"Russian","location":"Magdalinivka","transcription":{"text":"\n\nAugust 11, 2018 – Disciple Retreat in Magdalinivka – SB 4.30.10 \n \nThe following is a partially-edited transcription of a lecture given on August 11, 2018, at the \nDisciple Retreat in Magdalinivka, Ukraine: \n \n \nye tu mam rudra-gitena \nsayam pratah samahitah \nstuvanty aham kama-varan \ndasye prajnam ca sobhanam \n \nTRANSLATION \nThose who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence. \n \nPURPORT \nGood intelligence means going back home, back to Godhead. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita \n(10.10): \n \ntesam satata-yuktanam \nbhajatam priti-purvakam \ndadami buddhi-yogam tam \nyena mam upayanti te \n \n\"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by \nwhich they can come to Me.\" \n \nOne who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know that the highest \nperfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this verse it is \nindicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracetas, the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is \nthe way of the parampara system. If we follow the acaryas, we attain the same benefit as our \npredecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly \nhearing Bhagavad-gita from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no difference \nbetween hearing Bhagavad-gita directly from the Supreme Lord and following a personality like \nArjuna, who formerly heard Bhagavad-gita directly from the Lord. Sometimes foolish people \nargue that since Krsna is not present at the moment, one cannot take direct instructions from \nHim. Such foolish people do not know that there is no difference between directly hearing \nBhagavad-gita and reading it, as long as one accepts Bhagavad-gita as it is, spoken by the Lord. \nHowever, if one wants to understand Bhagavad-gita by his imperfect interpretations, one \ncannot possibly understand the mysteries of Bhagavad-gita, even though one may be a great \n\nscholar according to mundane estimation. \n \nNiranjana Swami: \n \nI'd like to put this verse a little bit into context before we speak about the purport Srila \nPrabhupada gave on the verse.  \n \nThis verse is spoken about the Pracetas, the sons of King Pracinabarhisat. King Pracinabarhisat \nbecame known as a Prajapati entrusted with the responsibility to create progeny. He had ten \nsons. He instructed his sons to prepare for householder life which for them meant to perform \nausterities for 10,000 years.  \n \nWhile traveling west to execute their father's order, they come upon a big lake, so big that it \nlooked like an ocean. They became captivated by the beautiful appearance of this lake. All of a \nsudden, they heard the sounds of drums, kettledrums and other instruments being played. The \nsounds were coming from within the lake. Just then, appearing from within the lake appeared \nLord Siva. Lord Siva came to them because he understood them to be highly qualified persons.  \n \nAn interesting point which I noticed when I was looking at these verses this morning is that Lord \nSiva was also attracted to the Pracetas because they were dedicated to following the order of \ntheir father. Prabhupada said in the purport that because they were surrendered to following \nthat order, Lord Siva saw the Pracetas as highly qualified persons and therefore he wanted to \ngive His association to them.  \n \nI bring this point up because yesterday we were talking about Dhruva Maharaja who was fixed \non the order of his mother. His mother requested him to follow the recommendations of his \nstepmother Suruci... to go to the forest to seek out the Supreme Lord, again, for the fulfillment \nof his desire. That point is made today in this verse also. By offering this prayer given by Lord \nSiva, the Lord told the Pracetas, \"they can both fulfill their desires and attain good intelligence.\" \n \nDhruva Maharaja went to the forest to seek out the Supreme Lord because he also wanted the \nfulfillment of his desires. We didn't speak that much on that point yesterday, but we know what \nhis desires were.  \n \nDhruva Maharaja was insulted and wanted revenge. He wanted to get a kingdom better than \nhis father's, grandfather's and great-grandfather's. He was so fixed on his mother's instructions \nthat when Narada Muni, who saw Dhruva Maharaja as a good candidate just as Lord Siva saw \nthe Pracetas as good candidates, gave Dhruva Maharaja instructions to return home, Dhruva \nMaharaja was more intent on going to the forest to obtain the darshan of the Supreme Lord. He \nhad desires he wanted fulfilled from Him.  \n \nNarada Muni tested Dhruva by instructing him, \"Just become equipoised, be self-satisfied. Do \nnot be disturbed by these things you are feeling in your heart, The forest is no place for a young \nboy like you. You're too young for such austerities. Wait until you are older.\", Dhruva Maharaja \n\nwas nonetheless fixed. \"No I have to seek out the Supreme Lord. I was told by my mother that \nHe can take care of everything for me. Sorry I know those are good instructions, but they don't \ntouch my heart. I've got something else on my mind. \n \nDhruva was fixed. \"I was told by my mother that the Lord will take care of my desires. She told \nme to go to the forest and you're telling me, 'Don't go to the forest.'\"  \n \nNarada Muni, an expert judge of time, place, and circumstances, then adjusted everything. He \nstill saw Dhruva as a good candidate and gave him instructions how he could get his desires \nfulfilled.  \n \nInterestingly, because it's similar to what we are going to hear about the Pracetas, Narada Muni \nalso gave Dhruva Maharaja a mantra to chant. He told him, \"If you chant this mantra you will be \nblessed by the Lord according to your desire.\" Srila Prabhupada explained in one purport in that \nsection about Dhruva Maharaja, that Dhruva Maharaja was initiated in the Visnu-mantra and \nwas given the mantra \"om namo bhagavate vasudevaya.\" \n \nIn the pastime with the Pracetas, the Pracetas had an order from their father. They were strictly \nfollowing his order, Lord Siva appeared to them, saw them as highly qualified persons, and told \nthem that because they were so qualified, he wanted to give them a mantra, or stotra, to \nchant. He told them that by chanting this mantra, \"...you will certainly achieve all your desired \nobjectives without fail.\" SB 4.24.79 \n \nIn connection to this point, I wanted to read a few verses from a previous chapter,  \n \n\"Although rendering devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and worshiping \nHim are very difficult, if one vibrates or simply reads this stotra [prayer] composed and sung by \nme [Lord Siva], he will very easily be able to invoke the mercy of the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead.\" (SB 4.24.76) \n \n\"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the dearmost objective of all auspicious benedictions. \nA human being who sings this song sung by me can please the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead. Such a devotee, being fixed in the Lord's devotional service, can acquire whatever he \nwants from the Supreme Lord. (SB 4.24.77) \n \nIn other words, Lord Siva is telling them, \"You can get whatever you desire to accomplish. \nWorship the Lord and get the fulfillment of your desire.\"  \n \nAnd in today's verse, after gaining darshan of the Lord, the Lord told the Pracetas,  \n \n\"Those who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence.\" (SB 4.30.10 \n \n\nAnd what did Prabhupada say in the purport today? What is good intelligence? Anyone \nremember what Prabhupada said? Yes...to go back to Godhead. That is good intelligence. He \nquotes the verse,  \n \ntesam satata-yuktanam \nbhajatam priti-purvakam \ndadami buddhi-yogam tam \nyena mam upayanti te \n \n\"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by \nwhich they can come to Me.\" (BG 10.10) \n \nThis is good intelligence. One gets the fulfillment of his desires and goes back to Godhead.  \n \nDhruva Maharaja got the fulfillment of his desires. However, in this case, when the Lord \nappeared to Dhruva and revealed all the desires that He would fulfill for him, Dhruva Maharaja \nwas completely distressed.  \n \nSomeone might ask, \"Why was he distressed? He got the fulfillment of his desires.\" But \nVisvanath Cakravarti Thakur explains that Dhruva Maharaja was distressed because the Lord \nfulfilled his previous desires. And after getting the darshan of the Lord, he realized that those \nprevious desires were so paltry, so petty. \n \nWhat were his previous desires? He wanted revenge. He wanted a kingdom. When the Lord \nappeared before Dhruva Maharaja, He told Dhruva Maharaja, \"You will get your father's throne \nand you will rule your father's kingdom for 36,000 years.\" That's what Dhruva wanted. He was \npreviously thinking, \"I couldn't sit on my father's lap. I want to be able to sit on the throne.\" But \nhe wanted something even greater than that. We'll get to that.  \n \nBut the first thing the Lord said was that \"You will rule the kingdom for 36,000 years. You will \nperform sacrifices. But you will remember Me. There will be no obstacles in your service as \nKing. You will remember the goal of your sacrifices.\" \n \nThe Lord detailed how Dhruva will rule his father's kingdom. After that, he will have a kingdom \neven better than Lord Brahma's. He will have his own planet, the polestar within this universe. \nWhen all planets in this universe are destroyed at the time of universal devastation, the \npolestar will remain. So ultimately he would rule a kingdom even better than Lord Brahma's.  \n \nIn addition, the Lord also told Dhruva, \"Your stepbrother will go to the forest to hunt and he will \nbe killed. Your stepmother, when she hears that her son has been killed in the forest, out of \ngreat despair, she will enter into the forest to look for her son and she will be devoured by a \nforest fire.\"  \n \nThese points were spoken directly to Dhruva by the Lord. And then the Lord departed.  \n\n \nAlthough Dhruva got the fulfillment of his desires, he was lamenting. \"What is the value of \nthose desires in relation to what I just experienced in the darshan of the Lord?\"  \n \nAdditionally, when the Lord appeared to Dhruva, Dhruva became so overwhelmed, he offered \nprayers to glorify the Lord. In those prayers which he personally composed, he asked for only \none benediction from the Lord. \"Please let me always be in the association of Your devotees.\" \n \nHowever, the Lord departed without saying anything about his new request. Visvanath \nCakravarti Thakur explains that that was the reason why Dhruva Maharaja was thrown into \nlamentation even though he got the darshan of the Lord. Dhruva realized that, \"The Lord \nfulfilled all of my previous desires, but He didn't respond to what I said when I saw Him.\" \nDhruva was therefore condemning himself, saying, \"I have prayed only for useless things. My \nactivities were exactly like treatment given to a person who is already dead.\" (SB 4.9.34) \n \nAnyway, Dhruva Maharaja received the fulfilment of his desires. After ruling his father's \nkingdom for 36,000 years, when it was time for him to go to his next destination, a flower \nairplane descended from Vaikuntha. Death personified appeared before him. Death personified \nis a very fearful personality to behold. Most living beings do not know how to deal with this \npersonality. But what did Dhruva Maharaja do? He stepped on the head of death personified \nand used his head as a step to get into the flower airplane to go back to Godhead. \n \nIn this connection, Narada Muni gives the analogy how lightning and illumination appear \nsimultaneously. Death is also like that for those who are fully absorbed in thinking of Krsna. This \nis how important it is to be engaged fully in devotional service. In that state of consciousness, \none is prepared to meet death personified. The transition becomes easier for a devotee fully \nengaged in devotional service.  \n \nIn summary, Dhruva Maharaja got the fulfillment of his desires. Because he worshipped the \nLord and faithfully chanted the mantra given to him by Narada Muni, he ultimately went back \nto Godhead. \n \nLord Siva is telling the Pracetas the same thing, \"Chant this prayer I've given to you, be fixed in \ndevotional service, and one can acquire whatever he wants from the Lord.\" \n \nIn an earlier chapter, it is stated,  \n \n\"A devotee who rises early in the morning and with folded hands chants these prayers sung by \nLord Siva and gives facility to others to hear them certainly becomes free from all bondage to \nfruitive activities.\" (SB 4.24.78) \n \n\"My dear sons of the King, the prayers I have recited to you are meant for pleasing the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead, the Supersoul. I advise you to recite these prayers, which are as \neffective as great austerities.\" (SB 4.24.79) \n\n \nThe Pracetas, received and accepted these prayers. They then performed austerities for 10,000 \nyears while meditating on these prayers that were given to them by Lord Siva. \n \nAfter performing their austerities and chanting this prayer, the Lord appeared to the Pracetas. \nThe Lord, being very pleased by their austerities, spoke an often-quoted verse expressing His \npleasure with the Pracetas' austerities.  \n \n\"The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear sons of the King, I am very much pleased \nby the friendly relationships among you. All of you are engaged in one occupation -- devotional \nservice. I am so pleased with your mutual friendship that I wish you all good fortune. Now you \nmay ask a benediction of Me.\" (SB 4.30.8) \n \nThis is the verse where Srila Prabhupada speaks about unity in devotional service in his purport.  \n \n\"The Lord continued: Those who remember you every evening of every day will become \nfriendly with their brothers and with all other living entities. (SB 4.30.9) \n \nThe Pracetas also offered prayers to the Lord. This is proper... to begin with glorification. We \nshould not just ask for the fulfillment of our desires. Neither does a devotee think, \"If I glorify \nthe Lord I'll get a better chance of getting my desire fulfilled.\" A devotee glorifies the Lord \nbecause he has understood the true glories of the Lord, and therefore he glorifies the Lord's \nqualities, His beauty, His characteristics, His dealings with devotees, His opulences, etc..  \n \nIn addition, in their prayers, the Pracetas requested, ...\"we pray that You will be satisfied with \nus. That is our benediction. We do not desire anything other than Your full satisfaction.\" (SB \n4.30.30) \n \nAnd their other request was: \n \n\"Dear Lord, as long as we have to remain within this material world due to our material \ncontamination and wander from one type of body to another and from one planet to another, \nwe pray that we may associate with those who are engaged in discussing Your pastimes. We \npray for this benediction life after life, in different bodily forms and on different planets.\" (SB \n4.30.33) \n \nWhy do we read, again and again, that devotees who are in the presence of the Lord, pray, \"Let \nme have the association of Your devotees?\" There must be a certain special quality of devotees \nthat inspires devotees to ask the Lord, \"Let me be in the association of Your devotees.\" \n \nThe devotee thinks, \"If I could be in the association of devotees who are always glorifying You, \nthen I'm protected. I'll never be able to forget You.\" That is what a devotee wants. Under all \ncircumstances, he wants to be able to remember the Lord. A devotee thinks, \"If I'm in the \nassociation of devotees who are always glorifying You, how can I forget You?\" \n\n \nThere are so many verses which give emphasis to the value of devotee association. \nIn fact it was Narada Muni who said to King Pracinibarhisat, the father of the Pracetas:  \n \n\"My dear King, in the place where pure devotees live, following the rules and regulations and \nthus purely conscious and engaged with great eagerness in hearing and chanting the glories of \nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, in that place if one gets a chance to hear their constant \nflow of nectar, which is exactly like the waves of a river, one will forget the necessities of life -- \nnamely hunger and thirst -- and become immune to all kinds of fear, lamentation and illusion.\" \n(SB 4.29.39–40) \n \nNarada Muni was giving King Pracinabarhisat good instruction. When Narada Muni first visited \nthe king he was trying to get him to give up his attachment to fruitive activities. He told the \nallegorical story of King Puranjana in an attempt to convince him to give up his attachments. \nAfter hearing about Puranjana and then receiving further instruction from Narada Muni, the \nKing achieved liberation and then the story of King Pracinabarhisat was finished. Vidura then \nasked Maitreya, \"Can you go back to the Pracetas? What happened to them? What did they \nachieve?\" \n \nSo as we were explaining before, the Pracetas got the darshan of the Lord. The Lord asked them \nfor a benediction and their only requests were, \"We ask that you be satisfied by our devotional \nservice and that we have the association of devotees.\" \n \nLet us remember, however, that they were performing austerities under the request of their \nfather who told them to prepare for householder life. So they wanted to fulfill the desire of \ntheir father. So what did the Lord tell them? He said that, \"Because you are all united in \ndevotional service, you will all have your own kingdoms.\" \n \nImagine, each of them having their own kingdoms with no quarreling amongst themselves. The \nLord said, \"You will always have friendly relationships with your brothers and friendly \nrelationships towards all living entities.\" And then He told them, \"You will rule those kingdoms \nfor one million years.\" A million years! Of course, it's a million of our years. In celestial years, it \nwould be less. \n \nAs the Lord told Prahlada Maharaja, He similarly told the Pracetas, \"You will always be engaged \nin sacrifice. I'll be satisfied by your sacrifices so that you will not forget the actual goal.\" \n \nSometimes one may think that, \"Once one gets the darshan of the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead one soon goes back to Godhead.\" It's like the happy ending of the story. He gets the \ndarshan of the Lord and then goes back to Godhead. But here we see in the case of Dhruva \nMaharaja, he remained, reigning over his father's kingdom for 36,000 years. With the \nPracetas... they were ruling over their kingdoms for one million years. But they would perform \ntheir duties in this world without forgetting the Lord.  \n \n\nThat is what Prabhupada explained in his purports, that we perform our duties in this world, we \ntake the mantra which has been given to us, we chant that mantra, obtaining the association of \nthe Lord, and then after performing our duties in this world perfectly in Krsna consciousness, \nwe go back to Godhead.  \n \nIt's how we are supposed to live in this world. It's not that we are all just going to chant and \nwait for the Lord to appear to deliver us. No. We must understand how to perform our duties in \nthis world, especially those duties which have been entrusted to us and take the mantra which \nhas been given to us.  \n \nSrila Prabhupada compared the mantra given to the Pracetas by Lord Siva to receiving the Hare \nKrsna mantra. By performing our duties in Krsna consciousness while chanting the Hare Krsna \nmahamantra, at the appropriate time, all perfection will be there.  \n \nThe point that Srila Prabhupada makes in today's purport is that we should follow the decisions \nmade by those persons who received instructions from the Lord. Following their decisions is as \ngood as receiving instructions from the Lord.  \n \nPrabhupada says, \"One who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know \nthat the highest perfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this \nverse it is indicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracetas, the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King \nPracinabarhisat, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is \nthe way of the parampara system. If we follow the acaryas, we attain the same benefit as our \npredecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly \nhearing Bhagavad-gita from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. (SB 4.30.10 Purport) \n \nOne follows the decisions of Arjuna. In other words, by having examples to follow we get \nstrength, courage, enthusiasm and determination to continue to execute our duties in this life.  \n \nWe oftentimes quote Sri Bhaktyaloka. We referred to that quote yesterday.  \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur explains: \n \n\"After receiving initiation and instructions from a bona fide guru, a fortunate disciple should \nfollow the path of the previous sadhus. Those who are proud neglect the previous mahajanas \nand create new paths. As a result, they soon proceed on their inauspicious path and ruin \nthemselves. It is said in the Skanda Purana: \n \nsa mrgyah sreyasam hetuh \npanthah santapa-varjitah \nanavapta-sramam purve \nyena santah pratasthire \n \n\n\"One should strictly follow the easy path which the previous mahajanas have accepted. That \npath bestows great auspiciousness and is devoid of all misery.\" (Sri Bhaktyaloka, Chapter 10) \n  \nWe speak on this point a lot. Actually this is the point I was asked to speak on today. I am just \ngetting to it now. But it's all connected. It's connected to Dhruva Maharaja, it's connected to \nthe Pracetas, it's connected to Haridas Thakur about whom Bhaktivinode Thakur speaks. He \nsays that we have to have examples, our mahajanas, from whom we take shelter. We must try \nto remember their activities and to remember their decisions in order to get strength. \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur continues,  \n \n\"By discussing the path of the previous sadhus, one gets determination, courage, and \nsatisfaction. \n \nWho does Bhaktivinode Thakur use as an example? He uses the example of Haridas Thakur. \nHaridas Thakur's path wasn't such an easy path to follow. But Bhaktivinode Thakur says that by \nremembering his path it becomes easy.  \n \nDoes that mean that we have to beaten through twenty-two marketplaces? Do we have to be \nthreatened to be killed? Persecuted? Haridas Thakur was subjected to so much. He was \ndragged to prison and threatened by the Kazi. He was told to give up his convictions and to stop \nchanting the holy names. Haridas Thakur's response was, \"You can cut my body to pieces but I \nwill never give up chanting the holy name of the Lord.\" \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur explains that Haridas Thakur taught by his example three very important \nprinciples to be followed by those who follow in the footsteps of previous sadhus. The first, is \nthat one must always be determined, in all circumstances, that \"Yes. I must be determined to \nexecute my duties in this world while remembering the Lord.  \n \nThe second is to never give up the chanting of Hare Krishna.  \n \nThe third principle is to be compassionate towards all other living beings. \n \nBhaktivinode Thakur says that this is the path given by our previous acaryas which must be \nfollowed. It's the easy path. What makes it the easy path to follow? Austerities for 10,000 years \nunder the water? This is the easy path to follow? To go to the forest to eat berries and dried   \nleaves, to then give up all eating, by living off breath alone? To perform severe austerities \nstanding on one toe? This is the easy path? To be threatened, to be beaten in twenty-two \nmarketplaces until death? This is the easy path I'm supposed to follow? \n \nBy remembering them or by following their decisions, whatever difficulties or obstacles we \nneed to overcome become easier for us to surrender. Without an example it's very difficult to \ndo something on our own. \n \n\nTherefore Bhaktivinode Thakur says that those who are proud create their own paths.  \n \n\"Those who are proud neglect the previous mahajanas and create new paths. As a result, they \nsoon proceed on their inauspicious path and ruin themselves.\" (Sri Bhaktyaloka, Chapter 10) \n \nIn other words, they have no one to follow for spiritual strength.  \n \nWe accept the path established by our mahajanas as our examples to follow. By remembering \nthem, whatever difficulties we have to undergo become easier. In comparison to them, our \nausterities are small. We make ourselves think that they are just so big, so difficult, impossible \nto overcome. \"How can I ever do it? This is too much.\" \n \nBut by remembering those who made good decisions and who showed by their example how \nthey crossed the ocean of material existence and went back home, back to Godhead, we get \nstrength, courage, determination and enthusiasm. It makes it easier. That's how it becomes the \neasy path. \n \nIn this regard, I've been telling devotees recently a very practical story I experienced. It means a \nlot to me. It moves my heart. It's what gave me strength. I'm sure that many have heard this \nstory, but I'll tell it again. I love telling it.  \n \nSarvajna dasa: About Sridhara Maharaja?  \n \nYes Sridhara Maharaja. It's such a perfect example. By remembering Sridhara Maharaja, I got \nstrength. We had a previous friendly relationship with each other before he came to Mayapura \nin 2004. When Sridhara Maharaja came to Mayapura, he understood he would soon be leaving \nthis world. He had two desires he wanted fulfilled before departing. He wanted to go to \nMayapura to take part in the installation of Panca Tattva and he wanted to be with his \ngodbrothers.  \n \nHe expressed those desires when he was told by Canadian doctors that he couldn't receive a \nliver transplant because the cancer had spread too far in his body. From Canada, he met \nIndradyumna Maharaja in London and then the two of them came together to Mayapura.  \n \nSridhara Maharaja liked my kirtans. One time when Sridhara Maharaja was staying in a \ndevotee's flat near Bhaktivedanta Hospital at the same time I was being treated in \nBhaktivedanta Hospital, Sridhara Maharaja called me and asked, \"Maharaja can you come over \nand chant with me?\" He was not terminally ill at that time. But he was having a lot of health \nproblems. He was staying in an apartment trying to recover from an earlier treatment.  \n \nSo as soon as I had an opportunity I went over and visited Maharaja. When I arrived I expressed \nhow happy I was to see him. The first thing he said to me was, \"You see that harmonium over \nthere? Can we chant?\" It was just myself and Sridhara Maharaja. The two of us just sat and had \nkirtan together. \n\n \nAnother time when he was in Bombay, Maharaja asked again if I could come. But I couldn't go \nthat time. I believe he was again staying someplace near the hospital in Bombay but I was in \nPune at the Pune Yatra. From Pune I had to immediately go someplace else. So I asked \nMaharaja to forgive me. I told him I couldn't come that time but next time I would definitely \nmake the time to visit and chant together with him. \n \nThe next time I saw Maharaja was in Mayapura. A large group of devotees assembled to receive \nhim. It was a wonderful reception. There's a little funny story in this connection. When \nMaharaja arrived he had all this red around his mouth. It looked like it was blood. When the \ndevotees saw him they were shocked, but nobody wanted to say anything. They came down \nand sat in the room with Sridhara Maharaja who then said, \"I was eating red candy.\"  \n \nAnyway, when I saw Sridhara Maharaja, I embraced him and I said, \"Sridhara Maharaja I'm just \nso happy to see you.\" One of Maharaja's desires was also to have was kirtan in his room every \nnight. So when I embraced Maharaja I just said, \"Maharaja if you want me, I'm available 24/7.\"    \n \nAs it turned out, Sridhara Maharaja did take part in the abhiseka. There are many pictures of \nhim bathing Lord Caitanya during the Panca Tattva abhiseka. He was so absorbed. After the \ndeities were installed Sridhara Maharaja was more or less restricted to his room. It was then \nwhen he had devotees come to his room every evening for kirtan.  \n \nMaharaja was oftentimes lying during these evening kirtans. He couldn't get up. His body was \nswollen, although he had a way of dismissing these things. Sridhara Maharaja was known as the \n\"Jolly Swami.\" He was happy to be in the association of devotees. Sometimes his stomach \nwould swell up with fluids and the doctors had to come in to remove the fluids from his \nstomach. His brothers and a couple of other devotees were there one time when the doctors \ncame in to do the procedure. Sridhara Maharaja turned to the doctor and said, \"It's a boy.\" \n \nAnyway, Maharaja's room was full of devotees, every night. Sridhara Maharaja, because he was \nlying in bed, would oftentimes dance with his arms because he couldn't get up to sit with the \ndevotees. He would say, \"Forgive me, I can't dance, but I'm dancing with you with my arms.\"  \n \nOne night, after the GBC meetings, I had a terrible headache. I was thinking, \"I don't know if I \ncan go to the kirtan tonight with this bad headache.\" I was of two minds. \"I told Sridhara \nMaharaja that I would be there every night, but maybe tonight is an exception.\" \n \nSo after the meeting, I wrote note to Mayapura dasa, Sridhara Maharaja's secretary. I wrote \nsomething like, \"Mayapura, could you please tell Sridhara Maharaja to forgive me. I'm not \ncoming this evening. I have a terrible headache. I'm going back to my room.\" At that time I was \nstaying in the Vaisnava Academy. I had to walk a bit of a distance from the meetings to the \nacademy. While I was walking to the academy, I started to think of Sridhara Maharaja. \"Wait a \nminute. Sridhara Maharaja is lying in bed with a terminal illness, having kirtan. He's in pain. \nWhat is my headache compared to what he is going through? I have a headache. But Sridhara \n\nMaharaja is dancing with his arms with the devotees in kirtan, and I have a little headache.\" \n \nWhile meditating on that, I started to think, \"Oh I better turn around. I better go back.\" What \nseemed to be very significant became insignificant by meditating on his example. I got strength \nfrom that example. So I went back, directly to Sridhara Maharaja's room. I opened up the door, \nstood in the doorway, and the room was full as it always was. I didn't want to go in because I \ndidn't want to step over any of the devotees. But Sridhara Maharaja looked up and saw me. He \nhad received the message from Mayapura. Maharaja looked at me and said, \"Come here.\" And I \nsaid, \"Maharaja, I don't want to disrupt all of the devotees.\" And Sridhara Maharaja said, \"No. \nCome here.\" And he told the devotees. \"Make room for Niranjana Swami.\" \n \nSo, I had to follow his instructions. He's my superior. I had no idea what was coming next. He \nsat up on the bed and said, \"Sit here.\" I was thinking, \"He is going to ask me to give a lecture?\" I \nhad no idea. So I sat down and I didn't know what's next. I don't remember if there was a kirtan \nat the time but I remember feeling like I was the center of attention. I was thinking, \"What's \nSridhara Maharaja going to do?\" \n \nSridhara Maharaja turns to his servant, Mayapura dasa, and says, \"Mayapura, give me the Tiger \nBalm.\" Do you know what Tiger Balm is? He took the Tiger Balm in his hands and said, \"Look at \nme.\" He took the Tiger Balm and started to massage my forehead with it. He just kept on \nmassaging my forehead. It went on for some time. The devotees resumed the kirtan and he was \njust massaging my forehead.  \n \nMaharaja was thinking of my headache. That's a Vaisnava. How can you not love such a \nVaisnava. Here he was thinking of my headache. Such compassion. Absorbed in the holy name. \nDetermined to be in the association of devotees. This is the path we follow. We don't just have \nto go to Bhagavatam to find examples. We can find so many examples in our lives of devotees \nwho are determined to serve under all circumstances. \n \nAnother example...I was just in Boston. There's a godbrother there of mine whose name is \nMukta Vandya dasa. He's a very simple-hearted devotee. He's always engaged in service. He's \nhad two heart attacks. He had one heart attack when he was living in Gita Nagari. He used to \nsell flowers every day in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which is about an hour away from Gita \nNagari. He was married at the time. He worked very hard selling flowers, but he would use \npractically all of the money he earned for the temple. In fact, he was sleeping in a small tool \nshed filled with tools.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu wasn't thinking about accummulating money for himself. He was just \nthinking about how to accummulate money for Radha Damodara and serve the temple. He \nwould work very hard. He'd work so hard that one day he had a heart attack on his way to \nwork. Krsna arranged that he had the heart attack while driving right close to the home of a \nperson who was his auto mechanic. When his mechanic saw him, he immediately knew what \nwas happening and called the hospital. He then had to be airlifted by a helicopter and was \ntaken to another hospital. They saved him. They put whatever they had to put in him. I believe \n\nit was a stent or something like that to open up the blockage.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu gradually recovered and continued to work. He was working a little bit \neasier though. After some time, he got rid of his home when his wife moved elsewhere. So he \nstayed in the basement of the temple building in a little corner. He kept all of his belongings \nthere. He continued to work every day selling flowers and continued to give his profits to the \ntemple.  \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu always wore very simple clothing. The van he drove for his flower \nbusiness was not very fancy. Unfortunately he had a second heart attack. By that time I was \nalready telling him. \"Mukta, you've got to slow down. You need to take care of your body. It's \nKrsna's body. It's not your body.\" He's loved by so many devotees. He's just a simple-hearted \ndevotee who always just wants to serve. \n \nNow Mukta Vandya Prabhu lives in the Boston temple. He's careful now not to push himself too \nhard. But he's still ready to do any service that needs to be done. He's just fully engaged in \nservice. If somebody comes to the temple, he preaches to them. He has no formal position. He \nhas a little room on the second floor of the temple. Whenever guests come to the temple, they \nalways go to see Mukta. He's the friend of everybody.  \n \nIf there's nobody to give class, Mukta Vandya will go downstairs to give Bhagavad-gita class. If \nthere's nobody to cook the offering, Mukta Vandya will be the first person to run down and \ncook for Radha Gopivallabha. \n \nThe day before I left Boston, one had to leave for Croatia because his father passed away. There \nwas nobody to buy all of the bhoga for a big feast for a big ceremony the temple was having the \nnext day. I arrived at the temple and came through back door of the temple. Mukta Vandya was \nstanding there by a van full of bhoga. He had gone to purchase all the bhoga for the feast with \nanother devotee who went with him to help to carry all of it. There was nobody to buy it, \nMukta Vandya just went out to do it. \n \nMukta Vandya Prabhu always goes and buys flowers for the deities. Everybody who knows him \nat the flower market loves him. Sometimes he's given thousands of dollars worth of flowers for \nfree. He's the friend of everybody. Ajata satru. He just wants to serve. He's careful. He doesn't \npush his body. He knows his limits. \n \nOnce every month for a few days he goes to serve Satsvarupa das Goswami. He took first \ninitiation from Srila Prabhpuada but second initiation from Satsvarupa das Goswami. So he goes \nthere just so that he can have an opportunity to serve.  \n \nI was telling the story the other night about Vaisnava Prema. Who was going to see Vaisnava \nPrema practically every day? Who took care of all of the arrangements for him? It was Mukta \nVandya. It was Mukta Vandya who told me the story which I shared with all of you the other \nday. When I asked Mukta Vandya, \"Is Vaisnava Prema in pain?\" He told me, \"I can't say for sure. \n\nWhen I was there two days ago, he was crying although he appeared to be asleep. He didn't \nknow I was there. He was speaking aloud though and was saying, \"How beautiful Vrndavana is.\" \nSo I don't know if he was crying from the pain or if he was crying because he was seeing the \nbeauty of Vrndavana.  \n \nIt was Mukta Vandya who made all of the arrangements after Vaisnava Prema departed. He \nalso visits another devotees whose name is Dina Dayal. He is currently in a nursing home. He \ngoes and brings him prasadam to him all of the time. Mukta Vandya lives for service.  \n \nWhy should we not meditate on such examples? Those who lives for service. This is good \nintelligence. This is the way to go back to Godhead. The way to go back to Godhead is to be \nabsorbed in service. Those who are absorbed in service are making the best preparation for \ngoing back to Godhead. When we think of them, we get strength, courage, enthusiasm and \nsatisfaction. We should be looking for such examples in our life. And, as Srila Prabhupada says \nin today's purport, which should look at their good decisions. This is parampara. This is what it \nmeans to follow in the footsteps of those who are teaching by their example how to make the \nright decisions to be engaged in devotional service.  \n \nHowever long they may have to live in this world, they'll continue living in this world \nperforming their duties. And to get both the fulfillment of their desires and good intelligence.  \n \nPrabhupada says, \"Good intelligence means to go back home, back to Godhead.\" This is what \nwe can learn from those who serve as examples. We should relish hearing about these \nexamples. These examples bring devotional service to life. It makes it real. It gives us a purpose \nfor living in this world. And it gives us a goal to achieve at the end of this life. \n \nThis is what Srila Prabhupada has instructed in this verse about the Pracetas. \n \nI'll read the verse again and then we will end.  \n \nThose who will offer Me the prayers composed by Lord Siva, both in the morning and in the \nevening, will be given benedictions by Me. In this way they can both fulfill their desires and \nattain good intelligence.\" \n \nI'm sorry I went a little bit late, but I hope the message was clear. Hare Krsna. \n \n ","attachment_name":"transcription_sb_4.30.10_english.pdf","attachment_link":"https://www.niranjanaswami.net/sites/default/files/attachments/transcription_sb_4.30.10_english.pdf"},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"ru":{"title":"11 августа, 2018 - Ретрит учеников - Магдалиновка - Ш.Б. 4.30.10 - Английский/ Русский","event":"Retreat","topic":"Шримад Бхагаватам","translation":"Русский","location":"Magdalinivka","transcription":{"text":"","attachment_name":""},"summary":{"text":"","attachment_name":"","attachment_link":""}},"counters":{"audio_page_view":0,"audio_play_count":0,"downloads":"129","video_page_view":0,"en_transcription_view":0,"ru_transcription_view":0,"en_summary_view":0,"ru_summary_view":0}}]
